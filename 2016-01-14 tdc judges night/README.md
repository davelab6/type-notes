FEAR is False Evidence Appearing Real. It can panic you, you freeze, but also it can drive you forwards. Our latest book is titled 'have no fear' and I want to look at some projects rooted in fear. 

We all make mistakes but should not be afriad to do so. Stories are inspirational, change agents, make timeless epxressions, and a great piece of type can look great even if teh text is offensive. 

Remember Shaw, that progress depends on the unreasonable man. We try to disrupt consumer expectations and suprise them. with design. So, some stories today, I'll skip through quite fast. 

Stories! Once upon a time, 30 years! and I still have a mortgage :) myself and 3 partners created a new business and told stories using words and pictures. we ended up creating pearlfisher, with a dream to create iconic brands. both challenger and iconic brands, and hope challenger brands will become iconic. 

We have 3 studies: futures, strategy, and design. The future studio looks at what is coming. Strategy desisng the story to be told. Design comes up with unexpected creative, visual solutions to tell the story. 

Cadbury's Daily Milk was an early project. the glass pouring was in the old 1900s brand and was lost. we brought it back. they came to us years later to soften it up. we made a film to illustrate this, we created an iconography for their communications. 

We had a set of richly painted icons, and the media and communications we could play with and communicate in another way was great. 

Next, Froosh. These are smoothies for the nordic regions; they didn't think it was pressed fruit, they thought it was full of additives. We used only tyopgraphy to say what is on the tin, no bad stuff, no dairy, 'better than botox'. this became the #1 smoothie in those areas. here's the company business cards. Even the company cars "fuelled by fruit". A simple message. 

Next, Lurpak. They were coming back, margerines were out at the time, and we created another video to show how the table experience was designed. 

Next, another iconic brand with a bottle shape and only typography - absolut. Here's another, from 17 years ago. We suggested doing flavored vodkas, but how to put a mandarin in a bottle? We put it on the punt at the base! The client made a factory to do this, no one had done it before. Just typography and that packaging idea. When Katrina hit, we did a 'new orleans' bottle. This is great, "SPARKLING" and "SP R  ING" to do two styles of water bottles. 

This is Seedlip; a non alcoholic spirit. A young guy saw an opportunity for this; using 18th C methods for distilling in copper stills to make this product. The seal was designed with the process equiptment in mind. 

This is Mr Jones, recently completed here in NYC. They allowed us to make bottle openers, matches, etc. Its sybolism to create the brand. 

This is Patrón, another vodka. We made a range of bottles for them. 

Jo Malone. She sold her name a few years back, and we made a new brand that expresses what she loves. Despite months of work, we ended up on the first concept, a simple red dot. perfection in the simplicity of it all. 

Green and Blacks. Our first client, a single shop in the UK at that time. They were adamant that organic was important at that time, and we made a piece of everyday luxury, and both fair trade and organic. Now its one of the biggest selling chocolates in the world. We set the bar body in dark brown, and many others caught on to this, including starbucks and marks and spender, so we changed the body to use the flavor driven colors. 

Nude. A perfect 4 letter words with absolute symmetry in a square. it belonged to Bono, and his wife also owned Eden. We got "Barefaced Beauty" trademarked and when you stripped the wrap, it was 'nude' on your shelf. 

Waitrose. This was a diet range, without using that word once. We did 400 products, on the shelf products, all we did was put in place a deliciously colorful photography. They did an additional millino pounds a week in these products that were selling fine alreayd. we did the longest 200ft billboard in the UK, 2.4 milion people saw it in London in 10 days. 

Strong. A nutrient range, unpronouncible words in nutrients meant we used used birds to depict things; the 'brain box' has an owl, the 'sunshine' pill a canary. It was a range to unclutter the labels as that was so typical of those labels. We also made these animations for instore video. 

"Spoylt". All the girls liked this, the 'y' is a heart / kiss said the women, and men say a pair of womens legs! She was delighted with this. 

Übershot. An energy drink. Again, a typography heavy solution. 

Wolfgang Puck. We remade the "WP" monogram, and everything used a specific angle, from the wine labels to the way he sliced his bread. 

Cheeky. This was a soho house brand aimed at younger girls. Hair products, lots of things. A 'dirty stop out' case for when you got back from the walk of shame. They also had a salon with a cafe integrated. 

The Library. This is something I have been more involved with; a new approach to a health club. A private members club that focuses on mental and physical well being. Books, stories, all immerse the clients into new areas; fencing as a sport. Amazing opportunities for kids these days! 

Jamie. "J me" as he didn't want his full name in the brand as it was about "me". Some products didnt even have his logo, each product range had its own tratemeant. even crisp packets. it was a great fun project. 

K Cider, one of our first projects. Still in use!

Q: Are you creating more larger families? THat seems odd, it makes it more expensive. WHy has demand for those increased?

Vik: Nowadays graphic designers dont do typographic pieces with jsut 2 styles, they are used to accessing these big families. We did it for digital platforms, so you can use within a digital platform from big screens to small screens, without swtiching families. That is our motivation. Changing widths and weights to fit the medium. In terms of design, we don't create each style by hand, you use interpolation which helps. Its not fully automatic but it speeds up the process. Its easier to do a bigger family. Also its feedback from clients who want them. 

Q: Sure, I don't use all styles, but I like to have the palette as if I say "I wish it was a little heavier/lighter" in the old days, well, now I can pick them.  

Nick Sherman: TypeTogether seems more proactive in terms of marketing. What is your relationship like with the distributors? I guess you make a lot of money with them but you are also competiting with them...

Vik: Its an ongoing concern. We will end up with less distributors and doing our own channel. We started out going to all the distributors to gain exposure, but we now stay more and more within our own shop. Its a competition in a way, but then while TT has become well known in some place, some distributors can reach an audience that won't ever come to us directly. You must look at the numbers; I am more protective of our brand than I used to be. You don't want to be associated with certain distributors. They more and more want you to be on their platforms, but I don't like that. I agree, I try to avoid too much overlap. 

Q: How do the 3 org parts, design, strategy and futures, fit togheter? As a client, do I interact with them each?

Karen: Futures we always had but it was integrated. Now if you are a client and come to us and say you are doing a new transportation system, our futures people will say, we've researched that and people would like slower travel in a balloon with luxury instead of a cramped aircraft. So we come up with ideas and we look at the human needs. We need eat, drink, homes, and we look at trends in those areas to indicate change. The futures team comes up with ideas to illustrate that. An idea can come from anywhere. And then Strategy looks to understand what a brand needs to say. You pick an non alcoholic distilled spirit, you don't have to drink, you can not be limited to standard choices, you can sip this spirit and be part of the social experience. And then the visual language becomes much more simple to execute. You see visual trends... say electric cards. Tesla has JUST got into the UK, but they are coming, and it will happen soon. You look at panels on buildings; now they have solar baloons to get power in that way. It could go into the glass of our windows. We see those things in the future. Then strategy comes up with what and how to say. 

Q: So you have clients just for future, or just for strategy?

Karen: Yep. We initially only did it for ourselves, so we understood how to design for clients. Only recently did we think we were **wasting** this resource, and made it available as a service. 

Q: Does this bring in clients for the other parts of the company?

Karen: Yes! We just started talking about this. The futures group has done great work in the last 20 years. The atlantic baloon idea was done 20 years, and we had a piece on the radio, and someone rang us up. Its amazing the rate of change, and that's what we try to understand. 

Q: Have you spun off any companies?

Karen: No, each proejct we start with looking at the problem; thats why strategy is so key. If we understand the problem, we can design a solution. If we don't understand the problem, we can go anywhere and nowhere. That's where the inventing comes from.
