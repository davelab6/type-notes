## Conference Day 1

### Dave Crossland: “Libre Fonts: Secrets Revealed”

I would like to tell you a story about my career, why I work on typography, what I have done, and what you can do. 

First I want to show you this video of a cat riding a roomba, scaring a duck. I want to explain why this is funny to me. We'll return to this later.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2HU3LGdbo

So, I worked with Gogle Fonts as a consultant. I should make a disclaimer that this is all my own personal views, not the views of any consulting client, such as Google.

Here is Google Fonts, with 100s of fonts that are fast, easy and free. They are available to everyone to use on any website. 

https://www.google.com/fonts

Hhere is the most popular video on youtube:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0

2.4B views, total.

As you can see on the Google Fonts analytics page, the most popular font, open sans, does 21B views per week. 3 per day!

https://www.google.com/fonts#Analytics:total

Here is a demo of how easy it is:

I grab some English and Thai text from Google Translate

So, why am I involved in this?

When I was a kid, I loved learning what I wanted to learn. I was kind of a bad kid. I didn't study too hard, so I could learn my own interests. I found Debian, a libre software project. I loved computers, and I loved Debian as I could learn everything, it was totally transparent. 

https://www.debian.org/

Later I studied Graphic Design, and I learned about Multiple Master fonts. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_master_fonts

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io6CF7TJWe4

But I became angry when I learned Adobe was removing support for this advanced feature. I thought back to the Debian software I used as a teenager, and what it means for tools to be transparent.

https://www.google.co.th/search?q=what+is+free+software?

The free software foundation promotes the idea of software freedom as a principle, that users of tools ought to be able to see how the tools work and change them to meet their needs. 

http://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software

Is it important to have this freedom? It doesn't matter, until it does. 

In the news recently is a scandal about the software in Volkswagen's cars, that was lying. If the software was libre, this would never happen. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal

Tools can be broken in 2 ways. There is the obvious bugs, the crashes that go unfixed longer than we would like. But there is a more subtle and more profound way things are broken: They can be missing things. 

Consider the wikipedia, which is the biggest encyclopedia ever made. A traditional encyclopedia can't have a page on this small topic. But wikipedia can, because it is libre; its potential is unlimited. 

So, as I got more into typography, and then type design, I realised that it was important to me that the fonts I use are libre licensed, so if they are broken I can fix them, or if they are missing things, I can add them. 

I found others were already working on this. SIL is a organiziation that made the Open Font License

http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=OFL_web

This license combines the needs of libre software develoeprs and type designers. 

To amke type, or to execerise the freedom in libre fonts, I thought I would need 3 things. Tools, Knowledge of how to use the tools, and a 3rd important ingredient. 

At the time there was 1 libre font editor, FontForge. 

http://fontforge.github.io/en-US/

It has a lot of features, but some problems. But if you want ot play with fonts and type design, it is available and you can learn with it. 

There are new editors today. 

Glyphr Studio is web based, so you can get started immediately, you don't even need to install it:

http://www.glyphrstudio.com/

There are also more advanced tools, like Metaoplator, a project I have been invovled in. This homepage shows the power of web based tools; like the old Multiple Master, you can adjust the typeface to the exact typography requirements. 

http://metapolator.com/home/

And there is a new editor, started by a fontforge developer, TruFont. I am very excited about this, and I recommend it. Here is a quick preview of it in action. It runs on Windows, Mac and GNU.

http://trufont.github.io/

So there are tools available. I also needed to learn how to use them, and I was influenced by this small book, Mastery. It says to master something, you must seek out good teachers. 

https://www.google.co.th/search?q=mastery+book

So I studied a Masters in Typeface Design, in England, close to where I grew up.

http://typefacedesign.net/

There are now web resources to learn, such as Design With FontForge.

http://designwithfontforge.com/en-US/index.html

The 3rd thing is a business model, so you can pay your rent to put the tools and knowledge into practice.

https://www.kickstarter.com/

Some libre fonts have been funded this way.

http://fundwebfonts.appspot.com/

The most successful has been Montserrat, which sought $5,000 but raised nerly $10,000 after 100s of poeple each contributed a small amount. 

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/julietaulanovsky/the-montserrat-typeface?ref=card

There are other models for such funding, that use the power of a work being libre and freely available to everyone to power the funding process. 

https://snowdrift.coop/

http://www.fund-io.com/

So, I have been lucky that when I graduated, web fonts was starting, and Google Fonts has been commissioning new fonts. But if you would like to make a libre font, you can raise money to pay for the work without Google, if you need to. 

This returns us to the cat riding the roomba.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Of2HU3LGdbo

Some people are worried that by making libre fonts, it may become impossible for others to make restricted licensed fonts. They see me as a scary shark, riding this big robot. 

But it is not true. When a font is available freely to everyone, that is not desirable for the people who pay for fonts. THey want fonts that not many other people have. 

The robot is going its own way, not really chasing the duck. 

In the same way, Google is seeking to make the web platform great. Great Android phones are now around US$100, and everyone in the world gets online with a smart phone, they will need good typography in their own script. 

This year a dozen Thai font families have been commissioned by Google from Cadson Demak, and there are 2 already available in the Google Fonts directory

https://www.google.com/fonts#ChoosePlace:select/Script:thai

All the fonts are available with sources on Github, and you are invited to study them and give feedback and participate in the development:

https://github.com/cadsondemak/

All the fonts in Googel Fonts are available in this way

https://github.com/google/fonts/

As more reading is done on smart phones, where often all you can see on a screen is text, the importance of typography is increasing.

### Smich Smanloh: “current currency เงินตรา ตราเงิน”

[ Was great, but in Thai ]


## Seok Geumho: “Structure and features in Hangul and fonts development”


## Seok Geumho: Structure and Features in Hangul Fonts development

First, I present a video about the structure of Hangeul. 

> Used everyday. Here is a glyph for heaven, earth, and humankind. THey come together to form vowels, that is what is beautiful about the script. Voels are symmvetrical, bright sounds, contrasting with the dark consonants. Here is a grid showing the variations from the 5 basic forms. Here is 'Bear', 'Door'. Here is a number pad input system, for H and Latin. Here is a comparison to Japanese and Chinese. Hangul is recognised as a great intellectual achievement and a cultural hertiage of the Korean people. 

KS 5601 standard has 2,350 characters, 96 latin basic. Unicode 4.0 had X,000 glyphs!

Latin is a linear system. Hangul is a non linear system. You can say T is one letter, but in Hangul, the first element is not a letter. When the elements combine, it creates 1 syllable, that is then a letter. So Thailand is 4 letters in Hangul. Cadson Demak is also 4 letters. The vowel and consonant can combine, horizontally or vertically, or be mixed. Cadson Demak has 4 letters, the first is horzontal, the 2nd is vertical, the other 2 are mixed. 

This maeans that type design is tricky; how to share white space properly? How to make the size the same among letters? How to find a baseline? How to make word space equal?

In hangul, the letters are often asymmetrical. In Chinese, the glyph for East is symmetrical. But in Hangul, it is not. 

How to overcome these difficulties?

Noto Sans CJK. 

I'd like to talk about my experience with Noto Sans. Last year it was annoucned by Google and Adobe: It has a 65,535 glyph set, in 7 weights. A total of 457,845 glyphs. 17k in Japnese, 34k in Chinese, 13k in Korean. Companies in China, Japan and Korea came together and collaborated. Here is a IUC14 slides from Ken Lunde, with a breakdown. 

It is a sans Serif CJK style. You can easily identify a Latin sans serif. But if you look at it in detail, there is complications for a 'unified design' font. The thickness of stems and bars are totally different in Korean, Chinese, Japanese and Latin. The Curve Style is not the same. The baseline is not the same. 

So a challenge to develop a multiscript CJK family is harmonising these things. 

We did an analysis for Hangul in the Noto project. 

Here is a Mincho CJK, a 'serif' like style of CJK. Is this a unified design? The bar and stem in Korean and Chinese are totally different. The terminals of a stem are absolutely different. So it is hard to make a design consistent among CJK scripts. That is the challenge.

Another aspect is alignment. You can see baseline, upperline, and center line. Each is always different in all 3 scripts. 

There are other problems, it is perhaps NOT POSSIBLE to make a mega-multi-script typeface. Baseline, letterspace, word space, direction of reading, contrast of strokes - these are typographic issues. There are also cultural issues; these may be more challenging. There are social customers differing and this extends to form: standards of beauty. What is a circle, what is a stroke.

How can we match visual balance in an internaional, multiscript typesetting? Can you give up your cultural habit? No. If you can not, it is impossible to make design unity. This is a very important issue for developing multiscript font design. 

We have an unusual tool, for combining the core elements to the 13,000 glyphs. We separate the glyphs into core shapes. [ Not sure I understood this correctly ]

Here is a SinoType slide showing the Noto Sans Chinese and Japanese variations for the same ideographs. They have the same meaning, but each nation has its own form. There is some logic in the font to supply the correct glyph for the language in use. 

Here is the full 7 weights and 4 scripts. here are the Sandoll designers. Here is the group of all east asian type companies and Adobe meeting at the Sandoll office. 

Sandoll has worked with global partners, and have some experience with multi script type design. Microsoft, Samsung, Hyundai, [ many others ]

Daumkakao, approached us for a type design, and we parterned with Dalton Maag. 

here are my questions for you:

* Is it possible to make design unifiying beween multiscripts? I think it is impossible. 

* Does it need to be compromised between cultural and design unity? We have cultural gaps, no one can give up their cultural habit, so we must respect each other, and discuss and collaborate. 

* How can we overcome the cultural gaps?

* What is your solution and answer? 

It is a hard problem. We must discuss about it, to develop together a practice of multiscript type design. 


Next subject, the font service business model: Sandoll Cloud. We launched in April last year. It is a font subscription service. Morisawa started 5 years ago, and Adobe, and other USA companies. Our could service set the culture; our fonts are updated MONTHLY. Users can use all 470++ fonts, and the price starts at USD $9/month. 

The business model is expensive, though; we have 4 kinds of products. THe basic structure for a long time was a font database in the company, that is packaged into a package on disk or CD, and physically delivered. We evolved a digital delivery platform. WE now use a Font Cloud, with GPL, 3rd party and our own fonts, that can be browsed in www.fontclub.co.kr There are 4 distribution channels, PC applications, Mobile applications (android, iOS) web fonts (type square) game platforms (unity asset store) and service platforms (Kakao Talk). 

We have CloudBridge so our users can simply check which font they want to use and activate. There is no memory problem or long font list, using this tool. It is a simple, easy to use tool. 

SandollCloud Camera for Android: Users can use many Sandoll fonts, freely, to experience many great fonts on their phones when sharing images with text overlaid. 

Recently we added new fonts, and we add more each month. 

Here is Sandoll Gothic Neo1, we collaborated with Christian Schwartz on this. 

Microsot, in 2005 for Windows Vista, we made this for them. 

This is our Mincho, we won the grand prize at the Granshan competition. 

Next, Brand Font Examples.

This is a Samsung group font, we worked for 7 years on this. A long time! They publish a critical report and history book, a special publication. You know text type is all similar, so its hard to find a way to maesure the impact. But they did; fthey found 18%+ readability, _9.4% legibility, adnd +14% sensitivity satisfaction. 

HyundaiCard is the most famous credit card company in Korea. Innovation in Art, was developed by Total Identity in Netherlands. Their company was a poor one before they started brand marketing. THey were -$500M. With marketing, after 4 years, they were +$250M. A very successful case. A strong influence to all kinds of Korean companies, so many companies now want their own brand fonts. The success factors were distinctive brands, with typo-branding.

Questions

Dave Crossland; Do you think there are technical problems with the OpenType format, c

A: No, OpenType and TTF is okay. 

Roger Black: With all the cultlurs, to make a unified design, its hard; people see thigns idfferently, wiht our own cultureal view. The brand fonts, they try to make design unity above all other considerations. What if you said no, we wont make a unified design, but we want to amek the same FEELING from readers in teh different culutrs. Say you have a latin typeface that is ELEGANT. We don't say, draw the same shapes. We say, make an ELEGANT Hangul font. Then let the forms fall where they may. 

A: Yes, we should respect the cultural habit. For design unity in brand fonts, we sometimes give up their cultural habit. I have seen this in my expereince. But in most cases its impossible to totally give up a cultural habit. 

Q: In the last case study, you said that using a font can improve sales. How can you evaluate using a font, and improving the marketing? 

A: ...

### Panuwat Usakulwattana: “Typing Thai and The Ghost of Typewriter”

Here is a modern office in the old days; typewriter emeant a new way of working. Also new literature. It was a key part of law and order, police work. Typewriters gave way to computers. Typewriters were made to make typeset documents quickly; also for fast data input, and making copies of documents. 

Arluck is a style of thair handwiriting, used before typewriters for consistency in record keeping. Her eis slanted thai script before hot metal type made Thai more commonly seen upright, causing thai handwriting to also go vertical. 

Typewriters were used in gov docs and perosnal letters, and they had an 'originality' and authenticity. However, documents from typewriters still required a personal touch, the ink signature. 

Postcards seem to be a survivor for handwriting. 

...

We dont' use Thai punctuation or currency because we don't know where they are on the keyboard

Originally typewriters had a grid key layout, but this changed to a carriage distribution optimsed layout. QWERTY was used in Latin, but each script needs its own standard. Pressing a latin letter is simple, but a hard press needed. Electric typewriters with soft keyboards help, increasing type speed. The combination keys helped go beyond latin. The next generation might soon only know on screen keyboards. Or even not that, only voice input. 

...

While THailand is not a powerhouse of hardware or software, we have a right to set a stndard for data input to those who make hw and sw.

We care about output, but never work togehter on input. Lack of common ground is a problem. From early typewriters to numeral keypad input, we are haunted by the same hghost. We always let new hardware change the way we write Thai.

### Parinya Rojarayanond: “New direction of Thai Font”

[ Parinya Rojarayanond is the founder of the pioneering Thai type foundry, started in the 1980s, www.dbfonts.biz ]

...

Thai Vertical Display Font. DB Angkana is like this, here it is with +500 tracking. The 'vertical lock' means the floating vowels keep their position. 

If the glyphs are rotated, the lock still works. so we can have even spacing between letters. 

...

DB SantiPab was an experiemntal font with square glyphs. DB GeoTypewriter was a similar design, using circles, squares and diagonals in a grid to make letterforms.
