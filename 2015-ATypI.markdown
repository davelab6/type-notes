DK: Web fonts allows us to quantify the impact that type designers have on the world, which is significant and important. 

DL: I’m David Lemon, stepping in for Matthew Reichs, my manager, who is unable to attend. 

JG: I’m John Gianopollis, and I’d like to show the real world situations with web fonts. 

DK: 4 things, Adoption update, technology, and the future. 

What is a web font? Here’s a great example of globo.com a local site using Open Sans from Google Fonts. 

Adoption: There are a few ways to determine if web fonts are in use. Eg in a browser look at the page source. HTTP Archive looks at the top 1,000 domains and looks at their homepage. The Google Fonts Large Scale Analysis looks at the whole web, including leaf pages, which are often where web fonts are used first on high traffic sites. 

We are now at 50% adoption on the Top 1000 pages! Truly amazing

Deep analysis shows even higher: 80% of new web sites use web fonts across the site. We see the 1,000% increase from 2013to 14 and to 15. A massive roll out of web fonts across those sites. 

We see 5 Bn pages, 2.5X since this time last year. A huge growth! 

There are 75 million domains, +15M in the last year, showing that there is a huge customer base. 

Also the rapid shift to mobile - faster than we on our team initially thought. In the last year an 11% increase, and quickly getting to 50% of all web views. 

Drilling in by country, we see Kenya at 80% of mobile, but huge counties like UK and Japan are way up. 

In script brekadown, latin/latin-ext are the biggest sets; 80% of GWF is latin, 8.9 is latin-ext, then cyrillic. A huge opportunity ahead on non-latin. 

Brazil! Looking at counties, Brasil is #2 for our traffic, and that’s fascinating for us. That’s 500M font views per day, we see Sao Paulo is the #1 country within Brasil, 83M font views per day. That is more than every city in the US except NYC! And its fun to relate them to other numbers. There’s 1M pizzas consumed per day in Sao Paulo, more than the total for Italy. 

Londrina Solid, by Marcleo, is 576M, and then Montserrat, Lobster and Bitter from Latin America. 

The most viewed video on youtube is Gingham Style, now at 2.4Bn. We serve 3Bn font views per day of Open Sans - our top font is PER DAY is bigger than the TOTAL views of top youtube. 

John predicted that web fonts would soon grow bigger than flash, and that is now true. 

JG: 

Its mind boggling how far we’ve come in the last 3-4 years. I wanted to look at the global market. Building content with fonts is changing and to the betterment of the whole indusry. In th e last few months, we knew that the market would shift form flash to html, and in the last 3months in particular, with the Power Saver Plugin, set to On, so you don’t autoplay content; Mozilla is blocking flash for various reasons; Facebook’s CSO is calling Flash EOL. 

In the ads space, the largest org for the creative community bpulisherd new guidelines that HTML5 is the preferred format for ads and flash is being deemphasised. After septemreb, major ad networks are no longer accepting flash. Why?

That’s easy. Lots of OPEN technologies out there. Huge Usage and reach. Powerful i18n. Modular. Multi application use. 

I think the reach is the biggest thing. So many devices support HTML5 and not flash. Rich media is soemthing users want everywhere. Its a multi app use tech - rich media, ebooks, games - all being done with HTML5 as a global standard. A tremendous amount of browser support globally. 

So, a hue upheaval for browsers and tech companies, the open standard, its a perfect storm in the  market place. Developers and creatives are looking to take the millions of flash content to convert to html5, and transcoders are converting flash to html5, but its not as successfully as they would hope for, and fonts is a huge topic in the discussions. 

The number 2 or 3 point is ‘what about the fonts?’ 

We see new use cases for fonts, digital ads, email marketing, these are real ways to publish content, using real fonts. Not text as images. 

But there are workflow issues to iron out. I go to orgs and talk to creative teams who don’t have matching sets of fonts. They have desktop fonts in 1 team, and web fonts in another team, and so on. that can lead to images of text! 

Traditional challenges, of file size, http request minimization, and End User Eduation. Knowing its LICENSED, that you must obey the EULAs, we must continue to educate the market about that. 

And new challenges. Digital advertising wants to do cross screen, responsive, dynamic content, SEO’d ads. Web Fonts is misunderstood outside the WWW. You have a 3rd party call for web fonts? that is blocked for a web ad! You lose your brand typography, that’s a problem. 

Page view tracking, is considered bad today by ad changes, but counting impressions is the basis for all businesses. What about ad blockers? Apple has made these big now. Anything considered ‘bad’ is blocked. That won’t help. URL domain restrictions will not work for digital advertising. 

We must become more flexible. Today, web fonts are tied to domains for security reasons and to support a business model. But in a world where a font can live on any ad server, any device, at any time, a URL restriction will not work. We must address this across the board. We must make our fonts work across the board. 
, they
But there is good news! Last year we couldn’t show you what I will now show you. There are now great tools on there for “in app” web font support-  WIX, SquarSpace, Adobe Muse;e digital ads, delta, elite, ResponsiveAds.com, Adcade which are making a great world for designers to alleviate some of the problems. A lot of developers started 10 years ago who are moving into ads, who PREFER hand coding HTML for ads. They try to convert Desktop fonts to web fonts. We know thats not a good thing to do. Tools are helping there, but as an industry, we should focus on how to help users understand fonts are IP and how to respect the licensing. 

Who has heard of WIX? They have a web hosting soluition with a  DIY UI. They integrate web fonts into that UI. Its not for professional designers, its for the mass market. That is a good thing. Elite, a Valley company ad serving, that has a DIY tool for people to make new html5 ads from scratch. They use free fonts, Google Fonts, custom fonts from a major brand, or go through a virtual type book to find the right font. Here’s a Flite example. The file size total is under 15kb. ResponsiveAds.com in NYC has a DIY tool, here is a video showing it making a RESPONSIVE ad using web fonts. We’ve seen this on the web for pages, but not for digital advertising. This is ALL browser based. Tumult Hype3 is a desktop app that has integrated the Monotype Fonts API. it has subsetting built in. It has all the features like animation that people are looking for. 

There are concerns of security. So email marketing uses HTML2 style images and basic CSS. They use safe system fonts. Its good to see at least that use of fonts. 

The tide is rising for all! New use cases, new addressable markets, more fonts lead to more content, and more money for everyone in the industry. If you look at all the page views and compared it to the page views of digital advertising, they are 100x what the page views are. The magnitude of the opportunity at hand. The APAC region is thirsty for fonts. Not just being able to use fonts, but to expand the library. Morisawa does amazing work. We want to see the whole region adopt web fonts and move forwards together. We’re not done yet!

David Lemon: Improvements in Performance. 

Speed is a key aspect of user experience. Faster = better, reducing file size, smarter downloading, and making more use of browser caches. Web font files are freqently not the largest filetype, but often the most sensitive to delays. Any delay is a bad user experience. So a lot of thought is going into making this as fast as possible. Making fonts smaller is obviously good. 

The main area there is improvements in the compression, with Brotli in WOFF2. That is now faster and better than the compression in WOFF and GZIP. Zopfli for prebuilding WOFF1 files (too slow to use dynamically). You can also recognise when TT hints are not needed and remove them - or serve CFF fonts. You can also do subsetting (downloading just a portion that you need.) This is essential for east asian fonts, which can be 5-15 Mb, which is overloading for web pages - yet the market demand is there for the same expressive demand we are accustomed to. Unicode-Range is a possible solution for this. 

Here’s a chart from yesterdays working group session on Woff2 vs other solutions. 

There are other CSS features for fonts. font-loading helps with more control of loading behavior. Resource Hints allows to front-load the loading of fonts. And HTTP/2 is starting to see adoption which allows parallel downloading, and server controlled push for some resources including fonts. 

Browser caching is key. Cross-site font caching is great (at least for Google Fonts, not great for all serving models with monetization models, but people are looking into that.) Also “stale while revalidate” helps. 

Subsetting was mentioned earlier. This is a technology that is crucial. TypeKit has a technology for Japanese fonts, I set the font, I paste in some Japanese text, and you see the font loaded. Now some more text, and you see a new subset is loaded. 

Opportuniies ahead! 

Google, Monotype and Adobe TYpekit stood on the stage last year and each company had said some areas that they saw as future challenges. This year, we saw that we are all on the same page about the challenges. We see the problems as industry wide and all aligned on these issues. 

We have great support for web fonts in Latin, but we need better browser support for OpenType layout. Its incomplete and inconsistent, so its a big challenge to do reasonable looking typography. This is esp important for complex scripts. East Asian fonts are working better with subsetting but vertical japanese support is virtually non existent. RTL support is still weak. 

We also need more simple flexible ways for licensing fonts that is more flexible and easier to work with. End users want Freedom, Flexiblity and Choice. If we can make is simple and easy then usage will continue to climb. 

Email and ads are untapped potential that need more infrastructure, not just licensing. So as the user experience imroves, we’ll see even more use of fonts. 

Key takeaways

Its really growing! Rate of adoption in the last 5 years has been amazing, its totally mainstream, with 50%+ usage, and lots of inspiring examples of the new web typography. Our latest microsite for http://acumin.typekit.com/history/ is serving 90 fonts, really fast!

Tech Day: Research
----------

“Kevin Larson, Ann Bessemans, Nathalie Dumont, Anand Vijay

Kevin Larson will collaborate on a “state of the union” talk on the legibility and reading research that’s happened over the past year.”

AB: …

#### Kevin Larson

KL: … Reading app that enhances reading. this mark up enhances reading comprehension by 10% immediately with no training. Dyslexia may be a visual crowding problem. Adding more space between letter, words and lines reduces this and helps dyslexics. This is just a feature to turn on, nots not stigmatizing. Critical for young kids. You can combine the comprehension markup with the spacing. 

David Lemon: Curious about spacing. Is there a sweet spot for the amount of space to add. Is what you show tested, or arbitary? 

KL: That work has not been done and should be. This is mimicking what was shown to work in the paper (in French and Italian.) 

#### Natalie DuMont

Continuing my PhD at Concordia on iterative design methology. I work with a succession of drafts; I do not start a project with a conclusion in mind. Each series is informed by those before. You explore a variety of ideas. I am often asked “how do you choose?” You set a clear design brief. You have your own design criteria (e.g. I think oblique stress in strokes is more legible that vertical) and the coherence of a concept. 

There are different methods; hand drawings, ssXX in Glyphs is easy to do alternatives, there are also Smart Components for parameters and interpolations inside GlyphsApp. There is also most systematic increments of parameters (using Python scripts.) 

Here you see 5 neck/spine strokes for an ‘a’ and 4 for the bowl, and using GlyphsApp Smart Components,  and scripts, I made a systematised set of iterations, stepping through to make all possible significant combinations, to iterate down into the choice I wanted. The labels show the design space location, plus a final number for manual iterations. 

here are the final 4 ‘a’ I developed. I selected the 2 right most. 



#### Anand Vijay at Monotype

Machine Learning is a subfield of AI where programs teach themselves by learning from example. The Natural Language Processing of Siri, Cortana, Google Now, the self driving cars, the recommendation engines of Amazon, the financial projections, the medical imaging… it will all get better. We at Monotype looked if we can use machine learning for fonts? Yes, we did research on 3 topics: Fonts similarity. Fonts pairing, a tricky problem. Fonts attributes, can they become comic, polite, masculine. 

Fonts similarity. We wanted to increase the human concept of similarity, e.g. see Arial, and be recommended Helvetica. We collected 200,000 data points from real users, and made a 3 layer neural network. This led to www.FontScout.com which I’ll demo now. 

Fonts pairing, a tricky problem. We asked normal people what pairs they liked, but there was no consensus. WE found a chart from Steve Matteson, and applied this to make 11 categories, and paired these according to the rules in the chart. Here’s a mockup for fonts.com where I select a font, and set a complementary font, and then hit a button to look at pairings, and it will generate new pairs. I can star a pair to pin in, and then bit the button to make more pairs. Finally I can drag my pairs into a collections tray at the bottom. 


Fonts attributes, can they become comic, polite, masculine? Another demo video. Here’s the 31 emotional attributes, which each has a percentage. i take “comic book” and set it to 50%, then I click again it set to 100%. Now lets set another attribute like Feminine to 100%. Then I remove the comic attribute and see all the very feminine fonts. Now lets say, Happy, and Calm. I can pin a font which keeps it at the top, and i can drag a font into a tray collection at the bottom. 

Conclusion

The 3 machines we made work like magic; it captures the idea and has knowledge now so it can work on new data. 

We want to use these ideas for typefaces and fonts and continue to explore. The future is great!

Questions

Q for MT: Have you tried applying machine learning to font design? Eg kerning, could you apply appropriate kerning by learning the kerning of other fonts?

A: We have not. 

Steve: We have looked at general font design for machine learning, but not kerning. Its a great idea! 

Si Daniels: If I disagree with what the brain says the personality of my font is, can I untag that, or does machine says no?

A: If we publish this work then perhaps you could have such feedback. But not today. 

Fabio Haag: What was the user data about the fonts were comic or other attributes? 

A: We picked 1,200 fonts, and used Amazon Mechanical Turk to ask users questions about the fonts. We used that data and looked if there were consensus for a attribute and a font. 

KL: If you take an attribute like Comic, you take mech turk data, then you learn that tag to the shape. How to verify the shapes work? We started with 1,200 fonts tagged, then we ran it on 5,000 fonts and reviewed the results, before scaling it to all 18,000 fonts.

Tech Day: Tools
—----------------

“Type tool gurus will bring us up to date on font development and testing tool advances over the last year, and provide sneak peeks into what’s coming soon.”

#### Glyphs

Rainer: We started with components, font in the TT spec, and we introduced in Glyphs 2.0 “Corner Components” where you have an open outline that is inserted live into another outline. The main idea was to facilitate serifs. This is an open outline, a direction like any contour, it goes counterclockwise, and you insert it into another node. You see an “A” here with a serif, you can see the curve is bent to make a smooth transition as the A is slanted. 

We also did “Smart Components” and this was initially intended for CJK fonts. In Latin, you have the exact same component like an “A” with all the diacritics. But here in Korean you see the same letter used 4 times, but each time it is slightly adjusted. If you do this with components, you can scale them, but this distorts things. So we thought to combine interpolation and components. So you add a couple of interpolation axes to your component, and you can dynamicaly adjust the shape. Its not squished, but interpolated. So you can reuse CJK radical or specially set up components. This works pretty well, and those at Granshan will have seen Toshi’s tibetan font that was made with this. 

What can we do about interpolation? Its great if you can do a big font family with 20 masters, but you have to draw them all. Wouldn’t 4 be better? or just 2? But then the problem is that while the instances can be good for many glyphs, some will need more masters. A common case is the ‘e’ where the bar can change. Here is glyphs, the top area is black on white where we draw our 2 masters, and the white on black is a preview showing the instances. We go from very light to a super heavy master. So, you see the crossbar is too light. So we have the ‘bracket trick’
 
Tim Ahrens contributed valuable code for this. You can have any number of masters on 3 axes, means you now can have more than 1 font family in a single glyphs file. Here is an example, 3 masters, this 2nd master has contrast but the 1st and 3rd do not. 1st is a thin, the 2nd is a high contrast black, and the 3rd is a no contrast black. Now we can export this and see what it looks like: Extrapolate a little bit, you can see display styles. Its easy to switch between masters. You can see the masters visualized; even with bracket layers this is visualized so you can always see what is relevant for interpolation of a glyph. Color coding of contours and components; the colors relate to the order, and also lines to show how the points are compatible. Fixing the orders of paths and components can be tricky, esp with 30 paths in a glyph, but we have a new “fix compatibility” window that allows you to drag and drop the path order. If you have incompatible layers, you get a red stripe on the top of the glyph. 

In v2.2 we announced in the blog post a new feature. We have corner components, and you can now put in complex paths and even left/right anchors that will be flipped. Also these smart components can BOOLEAN SUBTRACT when combined, which traditional TT components can not. 

Finally, web fonts formats. we added this to Glyphs, when you export, you have a web font section, WOFF, WOFF2, EOT, and CFF/TTF options. The autohint will be ttfautohint or the PS Adobe Autohinter based on which you choose. TTFA had an important update to 1.4 and its in Glyphs 2.2 already! 

Color Font formats are also new. They are tricky, there are 4 different formats, 3 are now standard (not the Apple one) but we support all 4. You can do classic layer fonts (although no nice preview) then you can do the MS COLR/CPAL tables, then Apple’s color Emoji, and finally with Glyphs 2.2 we support the SVG table, so you see this is a SVG file, and you just add a ‘sag’ named layer, and you can copy and paste a SVG into that layer, and it is exported, and you have everything SVG supports - can see the animation in Firefox! But the CPU required for rendering them is substantial. 

Another new thing in 2.2 is taking the Font Family farther. We have a new saving file format `.glyphsproject` - open a glyphs file, and it shows you all the masters and instances in the file, and you can edit their Custom Parameters. These can control the export process. 

Q: This is like Photoshop Actions?

A: Yes

Q: How was the animation made?

A: Plain SVG markup
 
#### FontLab 6

Thomas Phinney: This month I became the official President of FontLab, after a gradual transition, and Ted has retired. 

Adam Twardoch: I am now Director of Products, and we’ll talk about FontLab 6, an on-going project. I want to show where we are at, and summarize what we have been doing. There are 3 important aspects. First, drawing. 

Seriously Better Beziers!

We love curves, and try to make them better. Some designers want to control the form, not just points; balance, tension, Tunni Line and Point. 

The “Tunni Lines” a way to control segment tension. In addition to BCPs you can manipulate the tension very easily. You can make adjustments to the BCP handles with the extra point and line that Tunni describes. You can make 2 parallel contours have a parallel tunni line. 

We also have Point Sliders. You like your shape but want to adjust, but you have points at extrema. So you can slide a point without adjusting the contour at all, to a place to adjust it, then slide back to an extrema. 

Adjust big time in no time!

We have traditional interpolated nudge, per Christian Robertson’s plugin for FontLab 5. The handles are interpolated. We also have Power Nudge. so when you move the points, it finds other notes to move proportionally. You can tag nodes as ‘servants’ to move proportionally. 

Power Guides and a Magnet Tool. These tools all attempt to speed up your work. You can attach points to guidelines, and move the guidelines, and the nodes are interpolated. [ Its a mesh transform ] So this allows you to do interpolation with just 1 master. 

It now suggest snapping points. If you have standard stems, as well as snapping points across many glyphs, so you can match a structure towards neighboring glyphs. We have font and glyph guidelines, you can tag them, so they are shared across only some glyphs. 

Smooth the bumpy Curves! 

Some pro type designers are good at drawing smooth contours, but others need help. We took G2 curvature a bit further. 

Harmonize, from RMX tools.

Genius Node. This allows G2 smooth to be enforced [ like spiro ] 

Curvature

Eraser. Tim Ahrens says that in all other editors, if you remove a move, the curve can be improved, but we have the best algo he has seen 

We also have smart corners. So you can make live rounded corners. You can work with the underlying structure, and use 


Catch Glitches! 

Font Audit is back and improved, thanks to ideas in Tal Lemin’s Glyph Nanny. We polished the UI, and added View Curvature as seen in SpeedPunk and many CAD applications. 

Next Gen Drawing!

Power Brush. 

For drawing from scratch, you can apply a brush to a skeleton stroke, its live calligraphy, angle, thickness, endings. It won’t give perfect shapes but will give prototypes, you can set the stroke thickness. 

We have a Power Pencil, you can add and remove contours with this. 

Rapid Tool

I know some font editor makers, they have reservation to the Bezier Pen Tool. Some people don’t get it. Some people are superb with it. So we want a faster way to draw Beziers. So you click once for a corner, two for smooth; you have a single ‘rapid’ handle for off curve points. 

We have a traditional Bezier pen too. 

No more boundaries!

Fill and Scissors. Self intersecting, overlapping, we see how they work. We have a scissors tool that will automatically restore overlaps, and a fill tool to say what is transparent and which is black. SO you can make a dollar with an S and a | and only have the top and bottom bits of the bar sticking out filled. 

We added an ability to extend the nodes. 

Shapes!

We call our new components shapes, as there isn’t 1 outline in a glyph and other refer to it. Like subroutines in CFF, you have outlines that all refer to glyphs. so you can edit them anywhere they occur; no need to find the parent. Edit anywhere they occur. 

Unlimited Layers!

A new thing for FontLab, not just Mask and Background. 

You can navigate, search easily for different properties. You can sort, color flag glyphs, display different properties. 

We have live metrics, you can use expressions to refer to other sidebearings, its an expression engine, and we try to be friendly to other workflows and editors, so we can open Glyphs files, UFOs, we use Mutator Math based code rewriten in C++ so its 100x faster, so our interpolation engine can do an unlimited number of axes. So we are friendly to other tools. We don’t tell you move over to only FL6, no, all tools have their strengths, and we want to be part of that ecosystem. 

Slanted grids for italics. 

New Kerning UI, with previewing of kerning groups; not class based with a key glyphs, like UFO, but new kind of class that means you can’t have conflicts. 

New Anchors, that can be positioned with expressions. You can say the anchor is 50% between 2 guidelines. 

A few more things!

Yuri: Parameterised Fonts, is interesting. The problem of things like Adobe and another one [ I assume he means Prototype ] is that they all work with some special font. This is PT Serif, opened in FontLab 6. 

Now lets show a few glyphs, and sshow the parameters sidebar. This was added to the font simply. You can make the x eighth taller. Or Ascenders higher. descenders lower. Move the bar up. The midline of the caps. You can apply parameters not to some special made font, you can apply them with “power guides” - its not complicated to set them up. 

I open a glyph here, “B”, and you see the power line that I drag and the nodes follow. For A-Z it takes me 30 minutes to set up all the guides. I use this to link points, like in TT hinting, but much easier. Here is H, and our ‘Shapes’ are not just whole glyphs but also glyph parts. You can see how easy it is to make smart corners, attaching to any point, you can have all these things combined, smart shapes, power guidelines. 

If you work with a glyph, you can easily access similar glyphs. 

In CFF you have no components, so when we import a CFF binary, we auto detect linked shapes on opening, so it reconstructs them. 

Adam: so now the question is, when will it be available?

Now! www.fontlab.com/fl6 will tell you more about the product, movies, links to preliminary documentation, its available FOR FREE to try out, no built in limited, for Mac. A windows version will come at some point, and we hope you will get this, try it out, give us LOTS of feedback, and we’re here for the next few days, and listening on all the channels. 

Behdad: What happened to the name? 

Adam: Its FontLab 6 with the roman VI.
