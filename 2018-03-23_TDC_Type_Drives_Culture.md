Matteo Bologna

We have some type nerds at 

Mike Abbink, IBM

Tyler Smart, 

Leland

And after them, the type designers who made the type for these companies, Christian Schwartz and myself will present, and then we’ll have a panel. 

IBM! 

Mike

Thanks for the intro! :) “The making of IBM Plex”. First, I started on the XD&Brand team 3 years ago, and established a point of view on design and also a focus on typography. As a new team at IBM, making a typeface would elevate the conversation about typogrpahy and make a global impact. It would make POV on design, starting with type. 

Making a typeface is a big undertaking, especially at IBM. Contemporary, legible, functional - sure. Table stakes. But what is uniquely IBM and how to capture a POV in a typeface? 

There are giants of IBM design; Watson, the founder. And Watson Jr. How to please these guys and their legacy? Jr nrought in Eliot Noise, a MOMA curator and a modern designer that made IBM a design company, brining in Eames and Paul Rand. The systemaitzed thinking in the logo, red/white/blue. And the scale of type at IBM with 380k employees. THey can all get it overnight at once! 

So at IBM there are these 3 letters we all know. Its a no brainer to start from those 3 great letters. Great counter shapes, the stripes we know. Would that make it innately IBM’? Maybe. But there is more to it; other influences and themes. 

IBM introduced interchanable typewriter type (Courier, Orator, Prestige Elite, Pica 10, Letter Gothic, SCript 12 Gothic) and Courier is most well known. Here’s the designer. The Selectric was introduced with this magazine spread; “a new way to write” with the golf ball type. Another spread ad. The hero of the ad is the golf ball. 

So there is a history of type at IBM. Also other corp type, like Bodoni chosen by Paul Rand; the flatter verticals in counters, a slab form that goes well with the logo. 

We started with a Sans. Humantist? No. Geo? No, need text and wide usage contexts. Not neogrotesk like Helv or Grafik or other amazing ones. Nothing trendy like Ubuntu of 2011. So, classic Grotesk. Of the era when IBM was born, a touch of humantiy but some rigor. A double decker g. 

Another big IBM theme is “mankind and machine” an we were central to that discourse; the System 360 mainframe, our ads pointed out the relationship of mankind and the new relationship to machines. 

Watson is our AI tech, and a hit song that made #3 on the charts was made with this. 

A great theme. 

How to translate it to type? TImeless & distinct. 

IBM are key letters to start with. I love the ‘a’ and the o and l also helped. Then those 6 in italic. Then ‘bengtjy’ also in lowercase, italic, then serif, serif italic. 

The main things we used to guide our decisions were: Man, Natural, Timeless VS Machine, Engineered, Distinct

Then IBMGPRQ&7 and [lowercase] and looking at the counters only you see these themes. That shape is suitable for this concept, and related to IBM physical product design of typewriter cases in the 60s. Here are all the period shapes. 

We named it PLEX because its about components that sit in front; its the components of IBM. You see it against the logotype, but these ideas crafted the sequence of design making around each and every letter. 

Weights, the THIN was a very dramatic change, the radius is smaller yet it creates a distinct moment. The details really come to live at large pt sizes. At smaller sizes, the text sizes, it blends these details away so you don’t notice them too much. 

We are adding accents and making it global. We used selected certain teams use it early and got good feedback that we “finally” have our own typeface that is born of IBM and expresses our legacy. It elevated the conversation about typography immediately, even in the beta phase. 

But, we had a sans, and we knew we needed something for developers. We have 100,00s of engineers. So we wanted something for them. We have the monospace typefaces that coders use similarly today. We have this ITALIC 12 which is an amazing typeface; there was no Roman, it was suggested to go with Courier. We sketched, and looked at the same and expressed that more and more, a sibling italic even more in the Mono. 

We started with the Mono Italic first to be an expressive sibling for the sans. That italic 12 brings over-expressed things, like the ‘z’, and we love the contrast in that. Here are the weights. 

Then we did the roman version of the mono; its similar to the sans with adjustments to fit the monospace space available. We did 8 weights. 

And to be global, we looked at the depth of the typeface; CJK? Hindi? Thai? Yes. But before we wanted a condensed. 

This is all open source projects, you can download as soon as you want. 

Then looking at the serif, we wanted a ‘hybrid of the 3rd kind’; we used Bodoni but also Jenson and Jenson Italic. We looked at what we loved; the ball terminal, a cool mechanical thing - what would it mean to engineer that ball? Slabs that make sense. Jenson has humanistic things, heavier top serifs. The Jenson italic is very condensed and slanted; a strong angle. We saw the serif angle as a good place to be expressive. 

We looked at pixel anti aliasing for picking the angles. 

Here’s the final serif design. You see the skeleton is similar. The condensed italic from Jeson, the ball from Bodoni. A hybrid of Bodoni and Jenson. We did all the weights. 

We tested it in small sizes. I brought partners in to refine it, and we talked a lot about what type designers do, and then look at what engineers would do; repeating parts, what if this is on a grid? So we looked at being fluid and following the type designers’ eye, and we looked at over-engineering and over-rationalizing like an engineer might do. 

Here are the 3 italics; you see they are very different but also related. Here’s regular roman, and bolds. 

Mega international now! We have Cyrillic in sans, serif and even mono! Bold Monday really wanted the cyrillic mono and I love it. We also are doing more scripts, Hebrew is scheduled for June. It looks amazing. Greek. Devanagari, Arabic, Thai for this year. Next year, Bengali, Tamil, CJK. 

If you go to the IBM Logo Store you can guy some Plex stuff :) We have icons that look to the typeforms for inspiration and pull that into the icon system. It will live in all products we make - 1,000s of UIs that we make. Plex will be in all of them. I love big type in everything, so you can see Plex used well here. A new shell for the IBM quantum computer “Q”

Our logotypes and badges and lockups will use Plex. 

That’s it! 

Tyler Smart

I’m the senior creative director at Sephora. We want to help our clients to make their own best personal beauty. We looked at our visual brand ID to support that and type was key to that. We make many ad campaigns for our business objectives. The imagery was often unique per campaign. The type was all over the place and the ID was lost. 

Simimarly the logos were made over many teams and many years. We wanted a new typographic system to help the brand. We got Matteo to help make 4 custom typefaces to help with the brand positioning.

We did NOT work on the logo. It is well established as a global brand. First, Sephora Serif is made for fashion and beauty, and looked at the Bodoni and Didot types we all know in the industry. We made something a little different. Light, Book, Medium, Bold + Italics. 

Then we wanted a more functional thing for more informational text, so we made the Sephora Sans. We needed it for POS, price strips, website copy, etc. Our focus was function but we wanted to keep some personality. We also made in 4 weights + italics. 

We also wanted something VERY personal. The brand is like a beauty editor friend, so we made the Sephora Editor Script. That is very personal with penmanship of someone who knows what they are talking about. We wanted it written, with a set of contextual letterforms that respond to what is typed. 

And then we have the Sephora Script, a custom script for our young person’s brand. We wanted something youthful and unique; the brand copy is more conversational so we wanted a type for that. It also has similar contextual alternate functionality. 

How to create these scripts? We needed someone with the right hand to convey the personality of the brands, and Matteo’s girlfriend was perfect. We had her make skeletons and from the single skeleton we made both script fonts. 

Here are examples of how the fonts work with the brand in use. Here is the “Beauty INSIDER” brand that uses the fonts. The system of logos for the in store service offerings. The next ad campaign, an evergreen branding campaign that says beauty is yours to define for yourself. This one uses the bold and italics. This one uses the editori script to say “I am pretty magical” with the other type. For skincare, we used the serif in all caps to knock out of white bars for all titles. 

For a holiday campaign, we shot a campaign of our own store employees who are very diverse, and we highlighted their own beauty messages. The type works as a system, from large scale executions in window banners, to lightboxes in stores, or posters, to printed collateral in products. The copy, especially the numbers, looks good. It supports the product across many places. 

Also media, we have it on the website and social media. A custom type SYSTEM is key for our brand to be strong and expressed consistently in the right way. 

Thank you. 

Leland Maschmeyer

I work at Chobani, a yoghurt company. In the last 18 months I built a team and reworked the brand. It is a copmany with many great things but it took 75 mins to explani it all. Craft stories, origin stories, political... nothing was hanging together. THe typeface is a key, the more important thing to make the central Chobani story, and to make it bigger than yoghurt and make the company have energy. 

I like this conference title, “type drives culutre” and the reverse. I think at the start of a project about the bigger cultural context. Food as commodity or even technology; all the tech made to make rations for troops in Europe, and companies who wanted to use that capital good; we eat ARMY RATIONS repackaged. Dense nutrition, shelf life that goes into a ruck sack for 3 weeks and still taste good. 

But since 2000 we have a new culture of “food as real” where food is safe, pure, honest and virtuous. In the 60s the idea that consumers DEEPLY care about the supply chain would be crazy, but that is now clear. It isn’t just purity of your body but purity of the values you stand for. 

Chobani emerged in this new era? Our recipes are simple, and old world Turkish receipe? But that is not the energy. There are LOTS of yoghurt companies with that ethos. 

What I found was the narrative of food that is powerful, transformative. Like Aztecs drinking chocolate for super strength, to Pop Eye, to Mario’s growth mushrooms. Emerson in his biography would delve into words and their deep meaning. Food words are about transformative powers; miracle herbs, probiotics, SOUL FOOD. 

Those extra nutritional qualities are almost transcendental. Cooking is the act of using core elements of environment to transform things to be edible. You command fire, air, water, earth to grill, bake, boil, roast. 

And what is food used for? There are core identic stories like Eden and the Apple; the greeks had Hesperides, the Chinese had Peach Blossum Spring. There is always magic trees. The bible has the tree of life that had all kinds of foods that fed everyone in the garden. Was Eden a physical place? Or just a place where really good natural food is found?

I got the founder to reveal he grew up in the Munzur Valley in Turkey, a Edenic lush land teeming with food. The origin story of the valley is a magical shepherd with magic milk that when spilt made the river that is what makes the valley so farmable. 

So, the idea was to find something at the end of good food. “Happily Ever After” was put on a whiteboard and for me that landed the story not in academic arguments about food symbols, but a simple good vs evil story with potions that can be good or bad and heros and villains. That is what Chobani is about; small food companies making a revolution against the large food companies. People talk about buying us as a Trump protest, and funding the greater good of mankind. 

We did not want to get very preachy, so H.E.A. is about what you are moving towards not away from, and the idea of food as magic. 

Our packaging did NOT show that. It was kind of Apple style. Bleached white, photo of the berry itself. Black on white type. 

The type was made by Grant Hutchinson as a technology typeface in 1991 called “Broadband”. We also used Neutraface 2 Text, from Commercial Type. This is architecturally inspired by the modernist architect Robert Neutra. That didn’t make sense to me; clean and modern but not having any qualities of the food. 

When you have photos of pastures it would be jarring for me and make me tick ;) So I wanted to move from simplicity as modern and sleep to being innocent. 

So I looked at old fairy tale books. I wanted something with a nostalgic vibe, the Munzer valley legacy. I wanted a book of fairy tales your great gandfather had as a kid. 

We found these many type gestures. Rotated e, spiky serifs in s, IMPERFECTIONS of proportion. That is key to the brand; we are NOT refined, we are NOT engineered. The packaging is all exported from Happily Ever AFter. THey don't have up to date machinery. THey do things by hand. With intention and love. No MFA in color theory. 

Berton Hasabe made a serif for our logotype. We started with Times New Roman, a democratic face that everyone had - but a softer quality. We just did REgular, BOld, ITalic. Very simple.

A large x height. Ball terminals. Windor and Clearface that give perosnality. An openness, a brightness. I love the inconsistency in serifs, the tail of Q has a sense of craft. As you scale up the pt size you see these details come through. 

We threw a brand relaunch and the story of the founder getting an upstate factory to make something magical worked really well. So we moved away from Broadband to this. 

The bold has a lot of weight. People navigate shelves by brand first. There are a HUGE number of products competing. So the wordmark had to have weight so you could see it 10 feet away. 

This is the logotype. From flip, to smooth yoghurt. Our Twin Falls Idaho factory has this on the building, you can see it from FAR away :) We kept our brand typography templates very straightforward. Here it is on packaging, and finally this letter size page with the vine leaves border and centered text that says,

We believe good food can change lives. And we will use our food to improve as many lives as we can, for the next ten years and beyond. CHOBANI

Thank you. 

ECS

So, here is the panel with Christian. I see packaging as the first medium for Chobani, but Mike, what was your first medium for IBM Plex?

BA

Wow, IBM does all media, from old gnarly ones for small countries to the fanciest iPhone. We used it in large sizes at events as a beta test, and in small devices. It was wide!

ECS

A style you had in mind at Sephora?

Tyler

Yes, we knew it would set on photography so the things couldnt be too thin. It was a 360 approach, small size price text. We started on serif as the foundation. 

ECS

Yes in fashin the type is seen as separate even if used together a lot. 

Christian, you have many clients for custom type; you survey them to get at the heart of what they need? You have a process to make sure you find out what their problems are, and you also make something you like? Is that real or in my head?

CS

Chobani did that brand exploration to understand the emotional goals of where their rebrand was giong and what to feel like. We often spend time with questions asking people, and here we just listed because they had done all that internally. They knew what they wanted this to feel like. 

ECS

How did you validate it?

Tyler

It took 2 years before we saw it in campaigns. Then i had friends mention it to me, we saw the POV recognised. We do many categories and we kept some focus for each category of product. 

Leland

We wanted you to immediately know us from the logotype alone. This went live in November and so its new but we do want to see in 2 years and see that type and know Chobani. 

MA

Same, we launched the ibm.com/plex website today. We wanted to make it open source and let people react. It was overall very positive. I heard from a lot of internal folks that love it. 

ECS

You tell the C suite execs that this will change the brand and increase sales. At large companies, how much is your day to day high level thinking and delegating and how much do you do yourself?

Leland

We say “get dirty”, I am a lead but we do the work together. We try to show total solutions not pieces; the type is a piece. Our leadership sees packaging using the type. 

Tyler

Yes a big meeting culture so a lot of decks and calls. But we sit together building modboards to start and move from there. 

MA

Yes our team is very dirty, filthy in fact ;) For the type I had a luxury of 6 months to focus on the design with betas and sell that through. IBM C suit people love the legacy and heritage and with that story they are on board. Then you see it saves money in the end and they are very happy about that too.

ECS

CS and MB, how to deal with the history of type and relate that to clients who might know something about type. How do you distill more pointed questions to them?

MB

In the Sephora project there were important technical considerations. They used Didot like type forever, which I HATE as it is so generic. So as a type and brand company, we have importance to make the font to differentiate the company. We looked at the past and the point of failure for certain typefaces, and how to make the brand story be told in the type. 

CS

Some clients really want the history, they want to pay to be educated and feel like “here is all this history and here you are as the culmination of that.” So terminals looked a way at a time was not key to that project. It was more about fairytales, happily ever after, and what that feels like. The application was key. We started with 4 sketches. We narrowed it down to 2. We have ads, packaging, layouts. How to animate it? That seemed to make the decision. Every project is different, every client has things they focus on. 

ECS

Yes the history is interesting. How much client design thinking goes more academic? Do you think about the chapters of design history and where your work goes in that? Modernism, postmodernism, and where your work lies in the design canon?

MA

That was top of mind for us. IBM Design is Rand and Eames and a time of “greats” and “great curation” that we still talk about. Since then we went into software and services. Design was democratised to people who “shouldn’t” make design decisions but do. So we wanted to bring something that can unify so many people who make design at IBM, to make IBMers think about design and implement that. A design system is based on a design philosophy; the type is part of codifying the design philosophy that is different to 30 or 60 years ago. 

Tyler

I am very academic. We are drawing on influences always. I want to know the influences that go into initial work. Its never the form, the ideas behind the form. We don’t copy  forms,we look at the energy behind them and re-express that. I look at the story i am telling and the design culture to draw upon. Knowing we had a Chobani story about bringing design to food. I went to art history to draw from, and I found mid atlantic mid century quilt artwork. The imperfections, the storytelling. That vibe applied to food is not mechanical, it makes food enchanting. The Army DNA in all packaged food is denuding food as an uninteresting object. Choban is seeking to change that. The culture of food is changing and we were very concious of that. We pieced together a new language of magic. We had 1960s KodaChome super saturated and almost surreal idea of imagery. 

Leland

We booked back to our french roots but also forwards to what beauty can evolve to. Casting is now key to us. Casting real people is more and more popular but a POV on what that is and rooting it in our history is key. 

ECS

Yes, its 2018. You are all accomplished white dudes [applause] so I wonder what you think about the decisions you make for inclusion, gender balance, diversity, and considerations of sustainability. What are you contributing to with the power that you have? Eg, Tyler, the photography in your industry is traditionally not diverse. 

Tyler

Yes, we shot an 80 year old model, Ashley Gram a plus sized model, and our employees are a diverse group. The world is changing and we have a responsibility to represent the world around us.

Leland

I am the only white hetro male in our team. As we work, bring people into our narratives, then having that variety is important. Our latest campaign has many people of color, a woman playing an astronaut in a 60 minute feature film we are making. 

MA

IBM is an engineering company, and diversity is an on-going topic. We have a female CEO. My boss is a woman. The company wants everyone to be set up for success. We are a unified team, all our all hands meetings show us that we have good diversity in our team. 

MB

We care about diversity. We mix Sans and Didot and Scripts ;) I joke. We try to make it always fair who we work with. 

CS

Typefaces are often not recognised as things that exist and are made. Our team is racially diverse and CT tries to be a platform for underrepresented minorities. We have 3 HWM in tech, design and the business partner Paul. 

ECS

Good. So, we’re done!

## Sex Drugs and Rock and Roll: Typography and Lettering in the Underground

Steven Heller

The famous East Village scene in 1960s. WHen I was 15, this is where I wanted to be. The Rat, Other Scenes. The East Village Other (EVO) was where I wanted to be, I didn’t know about design, but I was drawn to a phenomenon that would transform mass media. EVO people didnt want me though. The village was a hippie center for the east coast. THe police targetted them but unlike WW2 creators no one risked their lives. 

Here are French and Czech anti nazi underground papers. Some were hand drwan and mimeographed, some were type written. The 60s underground press was contraband in the army. I was arrested twice. After high school I joined NYU as a journalism major, and learned to make layouts outside class. I loved the in your face arrogance, the fun. 

I learned a new language that my friends called “graphic design.” I loved the phototypositor. You could set photo headlines on photo paper that developed before your eyes. I also used the VariTyper to set headlines. This was more cumbersome. Letters on plastic disks. No nuanced letterspacing. The faces were feces, very limited. 

Then this beauty, the MTST, an IBM typewriter. You typed line by line on the left side of the page that was measured, and then on the right side, and it justified cols. Underground papers often didnt bother. The golf balls were expensive. 

I was 17 when I started at the NY Free Press. I was called a “mechanical artist” and I wanted to be a cartoonist illustrator but I didnt have the talent. I was promoted to Art Director. 

...

This all came to a head with Eye magazine

That was great for context of what I am going to talk about. I started lookig at gay porn... in a research capacity... and focused on the type. I loved to see this pacer publication “BOLD!” which has this great use of Stela and a swash L that is not in the digital typeface. This was done in a manual era of production and Stela in Letraset had it because you were placing letters by hand. 

Then this Drummer #6 cover from 1976 that is all type and cartoons is great - and this is in some ways easier to do by hand than on a computer. 

Here is a 1966 article that talks about the restr

Here is 1955 ‘mattachine review’ that sought to respectfully publish this stuff. Cheap headline type (LOOKS LIKE AMSTELVAR). 

There were these ‘coded’ magazines about “body building” or posing for sculpture artists. You see type used from inexpensive sources. Something that approaches the look of major publications. “Physique Pictorial” was made by a publisher who was mainly a photographer, not a typographer. 

...

These magazine covers have designers where the buyers don't care about the typography, they are there for the images, so you see amazing choices like “Studs and Leather” magazine taking this 19th C type. 

Letraset Compacta from 1963 was a early best seller that is very square and tightly spaced, perfect for a block of headlines that set solidly. A pro tool that grew over time as Letraset dominates the industry.

Here is Stars magazine, the Optima typesetting here is not amazing. The challenge was to find the typesetting shops that did not object to the contents of these magazines. This “Mandate” magazine apostrophe can only be that way because of letraset hand setting of type. That magazine rebranded and renamed but kept the layouts and the title typeface the same.

Letraset had “a handbook of products and techniques for the DIY communicator” and that happened in politics (civil rights) and music (punk rock) - people could make things themsleves and not be tampered down by the professional layers of production processes. You could do things with untrained hands. Type for headlines and articles. “The Advocate” started out as a weekly newspaper put together with Times New Roman and Microgramma. “Drummer” is interesting as a case study as the social mood allowed these things more and more. 

It started in early 1970s as almost a specimen of all the letraset typefaces. It jumped out, it drew the eye, so people could get their messages out. When the publisher bought the name, he kept some of that sensibility. 

## Looking At Music

Brian Roettinger

...

The Magna Carta Holy Grail had a hidden track made into the back that you had to tear out! 

The type was custom with a redacted bar through the type, this was used in merch and the whole campaign

The minute album like this is released there are remixed; here an black and white image with large type that is semi redacted like that was SUPER easy to do so there was A LOT of it. 

For Mark Ronson’s Uptown Special, the record as a logo was a symbol to be everywhere. He sent me the Germs logo, Rolling Stones... Its always fun when people send the best things in the world “maybe like this” ;) “No I don’t want to make something good” no! :) He sent me various music equiptment and it became this thing. I thought it would be the uptown special thing but that is now _him_. 

For Florence & The Machine, I always called them “Florence” not the whole band name. I thought just that name and a photo of her would be different but still understandbale and they were excited for that. We did a week long photo shoot in Mexico and at the time I knew it was not the right thing for a cover. We did a test shoot in a studio; no makeup, little lighting, not intended for use, just to get a vibe. When we got back I knew we should use those! No need to go to Mexico :) No we did use them elsewhere but the cover was a “test image.” There were 2 songs per 7 inch record. Each side of the cover had a photo of teh sky and the other side the ocean; 12 different custom blues. 

Miguel. For some artists the process starts in different places, its never the same. He wanted as a performer to have a typographic ID. Not a logo. So if you wrote his name its him, but you could say “coming soon” and know it was him too. This is still evolving. 

Ke$ha was the other end. We wanted to rebrand her as a new artist. The legal battles were ending so she had a rebirth. Artists have ideas and references. I show them ideas and get them into a lane to move forwards. Its very visual. An illustrator from Kentucky would do the actual visual, I made only a crude sketch. We did a photoshoot in the ocean and that image is real but the rest is drawn. She is abducted on a space ship and taken to another world. And this stuff is being translated to her live show set design. 

Then Kay Z 4:44 Campaign, his last and 13th album, we wanted to make a didacted stripped down and revealing design with as much or as little as we could do. It was this 4:44 lock up and then this JAY:Z that was added after a few weeks when people figured out what it was. ANd these 2 colors: PMS 719 and Black. THat was fine in spot, but in RGB and CMYK it was VERY inconsistent color. Larish New by Radim Pesko had a custom j and : which were exclusive, so you could easily tell a bootleg that way. Also this title “This is his 13th studio albuum” with its barcode, so he if you knew then you knew ;) All the billboards were send and delivered this way. Billboards, banners, trains, busses, all around the world. Before anyone knew what it was, people were guessing all over the internet and that was great to make all this buzz. The CD box had little to no information. The booklet just had photos of the billboards with the lock up. The tour, finished just this December, was this octagonal stage that raised and lowered with these massive motion screens floating above the audience that were fed from HDTV to grainy VHS. A videographer would make a small thing about that city that was used that night, so every night it was different. 

Finally, another self initiated project, another LA subculture. The Colby Printing Company from LA was a 3 union print shop in 1948 to closing in 2012. They did prints for anyone that was mainly letterpress based. ... The type with 3 color-bars posters with gradients, eg red yellow green for a reggae poster, were classic. Loud colors, bold type. This one is neon green. A lot of club promoters loved it. THe type could be wonky, wood type. Here is their heidelberg. Here is their _organized_ type room ;) There were no pro designs, it was jobbing typesetters who did their own thing. You gave them text and they got you a poster. If you gave directions it was only tips. They screen printed the fluorescent colors. Here is baloon script in use. It was a purely commercial thing; they had no sense of collection. They kept one poster for each year for taxes and then when the need to keep it was done, they dumped them. So they had only a few 100 at the end. These posters enabled small businesses; you had a moving company or a nail salon if you had the capital goods and a poster to market your business. So these posters became a staple of the city. Some were tragic. Rooms for rent, divorce lawyers, funeral homes. But made beautifully. Over the years many artists used Colby as a kind of medium. Some artists used them. “BURN IT DOWN” or “CEASE TO EXIST”. ANd these would exist in the city. “A spectecal and nothing strnage”. Quotes from artists. 

When Colby decided to shutter, I had a relationship with them so I could mine their archive and celebrate it. I could never sneak one so it was a big moment for me. Here is the exhibition space in LA. Here is the walls. The merch and music posters, and the artwork. You couldn’t tell what was what, sometimes. Ephemera from the shop. In the NY Art Book Fair we had it in Long Island and then in France too a few years later. We made a small documentary to go with the making of the book. 

Q: What size posters?

A: 14 x 22 and 22 x 28

Art directors ask for type that is beautiful or classic or elegant or feminine. This gets to Didot or Bodoni. But this is not more specific. Type designers can often make it heated! We should work on that :) But these words are problematic. I don’t like delicious to describe anything than food, nor sexy for type. 

How did high contrast Didones become such a dominant type choice in fashion?

Vogue? In the beginning there is Vogue, in 1892, and traces back to 1858 Englishman ... Vogue was to celebrate the ceremonial - for American aristocrats. Here is a 1907 cover with loopy caps. Here is a 1911 editorial spread with ornamented Vs, old styles. Here is a 1924 deco cover. A 1929 when MF Agha, a Russian born Turk became art director, and he believed the art direction was a foundation to a magazine; design no longer a mechanical skill but intrinsic to the value of the publication. He brought the modernist styles from Europe that was not used in the USA at that time. Trays were brought over on steamships? Or knockoffs with electroforms? Agha made a ‘purified typographic style’, this is in 1939 a condensed script and much experimentation of the Vogue logo. Another in 1939, inkblog script type, or oil paint brush. 

Fashion design is often about straight up theft; fashion begets fashion and design begets design. None of these established anything. The condensed script returns 6 issues later. THis makes the issues seem special and collectible; it was published twice a month so this was a lot of work. 

[ more covers into the 40s ] 

The interior spreads were adopting the high contrast Bodoni style. 

Carnell Snell (?) hired Alexey Brodovich (?) who was art director at Harper’s Bazaar for 24 years. Snell also hired Martin Monkaski (?) and Something Erte (?) who used scale and color as contructivist principles. They sketched and designed space with paper. He hired Europorean artists like Man Ray, and type followed photography. 

Today there is a fear of how type and photos interact, they can impede each other and get in eachothers way. The type can create drama. Would this col shape slanted make the pose more clear? This large type next to small echoes the depth of field of the photo on the opposite side of the spread. 

We see these women and their clothes and shapes and use those adjectives I started with. 

In 1992, Fabien Baron is the famous contemporary person to change the art direction of fashion. He came to NYC with nothing and with talent, persistence and white privilege he got to the top. His work on Harper’s Bazaar made Didot even more sculptural. 

THis overlapping of thin strokes went to beauty packaging, such as this NARS box using Helvetica Thin. Futura joins this language too. 

Such Geometric Sans co-existed with the Didots since the start. Elle Magazine launched in 1947 in France, but launched in USA with Futura. The art director said it was independent magazine going mainstream. Didot feels like the old definition of luxury. Collections are now tribes. Minimalism gave way to Street Style. The old visual language was lost. 

Today, what looks good instragrammed? 

So, Haute Couture origins in Paris by Charles Fredick Perth. Coco Chanel is the impetus for this. But before her, Hermes opened in 1837 and Louis Vuitton in 1844 (?). Leather goods, not clothes. Leather is branded like a potter’s hallmark. Chanel made coats and shirts. The CC logo never changed. In 1921, the G. Gucci shop opened in Florence. I love those G’s! :) This was his logo and logotype. 

So, an upmost faith in those precedents. 

There is a lot of hope that people will spend a lot of money, and Nick LeMessurier said “the voice telling you to buy is _like_ Louis Vuitton”. Here are the logos of 9 top labels that were the nexus of Parisian haute courture of the golden age in the 20s/30s. 

YSL took over in 1957 and made his own label using the exising visual language. 

In the late 40s, Italian labels like Emilio Pucci or Missoni or Armani (1975) all played with the existing visual language too. The new NYC designers like Calvin Klein in 1968 went more sans. 

Saint Laurent went for Helvetica in a 70s rebrand. YSL and SL were different. The latter adapts that spirit for that time. That makes Tom Ford’s logo make sense; he directed Gucci after the 1980s brand licensing made their brand ove rsaturated. 

Ford was beauty over youth, young but not naieve. Lagerfeld also a did this. 

What are these grot choices about? No one is taking chances. But if someone takes a jump, it is because they did something early, and then it is copied endlessly. 

Here is a digram of spotting an authentic Vuitton bag. The status of ownership makes a new form of artistocracy. This bag uses the LV in a new way. The interpretation of the brand mark becomes the focus of these brands. LV went first and many others followed. 

...

Graphics can represent class and authenticity. Moschino was meant to rebel against the mainstream, and extend the dada art movement to fashion. 

Here is Mimi Smith’s raincoat, made of plastic packaging, making a statement about waste and the environment. What does type mean when clothing someone? What is clothing that speaks? 

“Wordrobe” opens with this Scarlett Letter quote. How clothing expresses somethign on the inside can be literally expressed with text and type. Here are paper dresses 100 years apart from the mid 1900s and 1800s.

## Emily Oberman

ECS

A partner at Pentagram who worked on many things and will talk about women on the Verge

EO

Hi! There are a few things I want to say. I am Emily Oberman and I do many different kinds of work. There is the #metoo and #timesup movements; I see women (designers) on the verge, of a new moment. AKA, the strong (but not so) Silent Type. 

What we use to get ideas out there. 

I do entertainment industry and pop culture work. Some type driven projects, type we designed, and also those that use of existing typefaces.

We design the SNL open. We did the Justice League movie logotype, Justice League Super Condensed, and branding. Ready Player One is coming out soon. We designed the title, with an east egg in the counterform. 

We did the ID for the Film Independent “Spirit Awards”, an anti-oscars. It is all type based. We did this with Grilli Type.  

The Rotten Tomatos logo that began with Futura. 

Wizarding World is a new film pairing Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts movies, and has a new typeface “Harry Beast” and also “Fontastic Beast” and there is another wizarding film that we made “Crimes New Roman” for.

But there are other kinds of culture besides POP. I was always taught to be subversive, and to speak my truth. When I worked for Tibor Kalman at M&Co, in late 80s and early 90s, the Gulf War and GB era. Here is me with those 3 designers. Here’s an ad for Paper magazine, “Fuck Bush. Vote.” 

The idea of getting ideas out in the world, as Milton said, its about design about ideas and thinking and we use any means do that. This is me and Bonnie in the 90s. We did a campaign for Air America Radio, the idea was left wing radio to counter right wing radio, and this poster slogan is “because he doesn’t read” - kind of like our current president but way better in hindsight ;) Other slogans like “The War on Enron” and we obviously failed as GWB was elected. 

So, my Mom was a feminist, who told me women deserve the same as men. The typography I do is super not feminine! I express language the way I want. My pop culture was curated, I could not watch anything with the women treated as lesser than the man. “I love Lucy” had a bad man who treated his wife poorly as not his equal. Here’s Mom today. Her views, always outspoken, aggressively anti organized religion, anti right wing, anti, anti. A good egg. So she graduated from Cooper Union and then caring for her ailing mother, at the time that there were the McCarthy hearings about Roy Coen and David Shine (?) - the first “trial of the century” on TV, like OJ. She did these pen and ink drawings from TV. Joseph Welch who ended it with “have you no decency sir” and anyway I found them many years later and used them in “Pentagram Papers 43” called “Drawing McCarthy”. We got Viktor Navasky to write about McCarthy. We published these amazing drawings. 

So, The Wing. A women only co working space. This is Bianco Sans, Bianco Serif and Bureau Grotesque, and anything else we want. They have a few ideas. Refresh: An oasis for women. No, we wanted “The Wing” like spreading your wings and having a wing man. We did this when we thought Hillary would win, and we would bask in the power we thought we had. But it became this other thing, where being a prominent woman is now a political thing. So we went back to the 1st wave feminists who got the vote, and we looked at women being 

“The Wing is many things on any given day” - it is multitudes. We made a board of the women who would be members of the wing. Then gave them each a W. Some are funny , or simple, or strange. Then looked for one that would be the org. Strong and curvy. 

Then we did this manifesto poster. Then this matches box, and pins. They themselves say they are “not a sorority but a coven” so we made all kinds of things. T shirts. A hat saing “girls doing whatever the fuck they want in 2017” and a T Shirt saying “Command Respect” and there is a whole line. These things always make a statement. 

We did the website, social media, the language for them that is all this fun and poppy stuff so you can say what you want that is friendly and great and gets your opinion across in a strong way. We took archival images and put the logo into them. We put Ws on the tables. This is the soho space. The logo on the floor interazzo. The Perch, their restaurant. 

A wry look.

“No Man’s Land” is the magazine, issue 01 in fall 2017, for publishing things by anyone who identifies as a woman. I published an article about all the feminist magazines. It has a centerfold with stickers. 

So, that’s The Wing. 

Together. Jennifer Rudolph Walsh puts a conference together for women to empower them, all female speakers; a story telling conferene. For women to connect and talk about their ideas and their lives. They wanted this purple script. Their event looked like THIS and they didn’t know why other didn’t get involved or excited. So we rebranded as this all caps wood block type. https://www.togetherlive.com . So now they sold out in all their cities; not only the design but they got some great speakers. 

The Federation. I knew a woman who did something at Sundance about 4%; only 4% of filmmakers in Hollywood are women. This org grew out of the travel ban protests and wants to fight the defunding of the arts. It is in Druk and Sharp Grotesk, a type of the revolution and a type because because. Laura Michalchyshyn and Yanya Selvaratnam and Laurie Anderson did this. I did a cover for her “Strange Angels” at M&Co, a photo of her with the name and title in a curve. And then Debbie {surname} who collaborated with me on this project. A protest logo. We made this logo, this logotype, and this color scheme. The logo is at an angle so it can brand other unrelated logos on a square. We designed the website. Laurie put together a playlist for people to listen to on the March. “Art Action Day Playlist” and we did motion design for each song. Here is it in use in the world. 

2x2. AIGA wanted to start a campaign to double the amount of women in leadership roles in graphic design and work on promotion and pay, over the next 2 years. Franklin Gothic Condensed and UltraMagnetic were the types used. But 2x2 seemed a little cold. Linda Dekker, and [someone] and [someone] and Laura Konkel from Blue State Digital to do this. A designer on my team thought “double or nothing” is more what we are talking and so its not 2x2 any more! Double or nothing, meaning we won’t stop. This is not just a bunch of designers making posters, it is more than that; we want people to commit to doing this. We made notebooks and the website. https://doubleornothing.aiga.org . So we have companies pledge to change and we see who is doing it and who is not. 

Unstoppable. This is Planned Parenthood’s movement to support the people fighting to take back America. We use Alternate Gothic and Avenir. The type does the heavy lifting in all these things. These are grass roots orgs. Type is not as much as a photo shoot. The Wing or No Man’s Land, we make typography that has voice and tone and personality, and then for other projects you step back to let the type tell the story with nothing too strong, like in this project. 

Don’t stop! 

Thanks to all the designers who worked on all this work with me, they are all amazing and I am so thankful to all of them, including the project managers who made the projects happen. 

Thank you.

You were evacuated in WW2 as a kid?

MC
When I was 2. I grew up with the bomb craters. I grew up with it. Small boys love it - finding shrapnel in the ground!! It wasn’t that I knew pre-war life and I was 7 when it ended. I remember Churchill addressing the nation, especially when it was going badly, and my Mum got me out of bed to listen to him. There was a feeling in the war, even at at 3-4 years old, that i had to listen to him and take it seriously and be part of it. We lived in South London so the doodlebugs and V2 rockets could run out of fuel and land there, we were vulnerable. So we moved to the countryside. I had a real sense that someone was trying to kill us. So when V day happened it was an amazing feeling. 

DM
How did those early experiences shape you?

MC
Hard to say. When evacuated you didn’t take much with you. 

DM
You got in trouble as a kid for pouring liquid clay into a type mould to make type?

MC
My father spent most of the war in Palestine, too old to fight but knew many languages. I went to boarding school around 7 years ago. The war made it more common for schools to take younger kids. I asked my parents why they sent me at that age... She saidI had insisted on it! I have no idea why :) 

DM
You felt like a misfit?

MC
I went to a UK private school, what is called there a “public school” which was meant to be the best, but it was very bare. Alan Fletcher had the same experience. They got better soon after. I talked to Peter Gabriel who went to the same school a dozen years later, the Victorian claptrap was gone. They wanted you to be a Bishop, a General, or a Banker. Alan and I would not be any of those. Alan had huge self confidence, but I didn’t and so I felt I had minimal prospects; school said I was a no hoper. What would I do with myself? I had no idea. My dad thought I should go to work in a museum; he had worked at the state Stationary office, who made books for museums, and he’d met Curators at the V&A Museum to learn about embroidery or armour. He saw that they worked on collection acquisitions and studying, and that you moved up as people retired. The the idea changed radically and ‘fun for all the family’. Anyway I didn’t go into that sector. 

DM
You had an internship at Enschede? You were meant to work in various depts and spent all your time in the type dept in “punchcutting”?

MC
Yes, I had a year to fill between high school and university. My dad knew this excellent printing company in the Netherlands, which is still in business, and they were unique in that as a printer they made their own type in house, but in an old school way. Jan van Krimpen was their designer at the time, and they had a punchcutter Radik [Someone]. No one knows how Gutenberg worked, but since 1500 the way to make type didnt change much. So I spent a summer learning an obsolete and useless trade, and I was very interested in it. I went to University for Medieval English at Oxford, and I didn’t fancy this. I said to my Dad I didn’t want to go; I expected a huge row, as Dad had been there, but astonishingly they said “fine.” I guess I saved them the fees ;) So I began working. I did engraving, cut punches, some brass plates. I taught myself to design and measure type. I couldn’t make a living as an engraver. 

DM
What is a smoke proof? How to make one? I found that fascinating in my research!

MC
So, when I was there at Enschede, I met Carl Dare (?) who did a similar thing, and he filmed a day in teh life there “Gravers and FIles.” This shows a smoke proof. When you cut a punch, hold it in the soot of a candle flame, then dab that on paper to ‘print’ the soot. This will be wrong, so you work it from there. Today it is hard to persuade students that the first time someone digitized type and printed them real size in real time, that was amazing for a type designer to see their letters in text in real time. At Linotype, you had to wait because it interfered with production runs. A trial font could be DAYS before you could SEE what you had done in use. Smoke proofs were for punchcutters to have some idea what their letter looked like, because you struck the matrix and moved on. 

DM
Wow. How far we have come! Looking at that type can’t be very accurate?

MC
If you do it right, the letterform is precise, but there is no spacing; we would cut smoke proofs and space them into words. It was not satisfactory but it was the only way. 

DM
So, you didn’t go to Oxford University?

MC
Right. It took more than  year to perfect the punchcutting craft, i had some journeyman skills. But I was interested in type. My Dad never pushed me, “who needs two typographers in a family?” Boring dinner conversation ;) But he was pleased and didn’t push me. I genuinely liked my time in the Netherlands and did not like the idea of studying medieval poetry, that was the point. 

DM
So you drew sans type with Alan Fletcher and Colin Forbes, Pentragram founding partners, when that wasn’t popular?

MC
I moved to London in 58 and in 60 I was given #300 (a lot of money in 1960) and I chose to spend it on coming to NYC. I can’t remember why. I spent a few months in the spring of 1960 here. I went to Pushpin. Lubalin. I saw graphic design that I had never seen before. But the thing that turned me on the most was seeing Mergenthaler Linotype. Mike Parker was the assistant to Anthony Jackson [?]. It was a dark satanic mil in the Brooklyn Navy Yards. I let Anthony Jackson know I was interested but didn’t have the skills then. Alan had been to Yale and worked in this country so I did worked for him, and then Bob Gill in London. Derek Birdsill. Collins. Some great graphic designers who wanted to be working in an internationalist modernist style. But UK printing was very conservative. In 1961, no one in London had Helvetica. No one imported it. No one. They had Stephenson Blake and Monotype UK catalogs. The time lag was crazy by today’s standards. But I benefitted. I could draw logotypes or whole alphabets for those designers. They were very exacting, needing it right and right on time. So it was good for me. 

And then Bob left the agency and Fletcher Forms Gill in 1962, and said I could be his assistant. I knew them well. Alan took me aside and said no, don’t do that. Why not? He said, if there is any designing, we 3 will do it. I was disappointed, but I didn’t join. I realised this was a very Alan like strange vote of confidence: He said, don’t be an assistant, go your own way as a designer. Then I took on anything I could find. 

DM
Your first big break, then?

MC
Well in my memory some of the work for them at that time was a break. But some strands in early life didn’t tie together. The UK private press, Doves Press, etc, all that, and I read about that, Stanley Morrison was the don of type for my parent’s generation, he said that the multiplication of information is the art of printing. Not the limited editions and fine private press stuff. That hit me in a big way. So I was excited to go to Mergenthaler in 1960. The newspapers and telephone directories and textbooks and timetables were important! They were not set by hand in fancy paper but by machine on cheap paper. I really wanted to get into that aspect, not the bespoke craft aspect. So I got a job in the UK “lumitype” vendor. The UK had another name for it. But the fonts were all made in Paris. So I was there once a month to specify type, and to draw my own sometimes, and this put me in touch with Adrien Frutiger. By then he was not full time, he had his own studio, and I visited him there. I got to know him well and admired him enourmously. Like Alan, he didn’t say “this is how to do an ‘a’” - I had to figure that out myself. But I arrived with no credentials and they treated me like I knew what I was doing. When someone EXPECTS you to do good work, looking closely and nervous you will screw up, you will. But if they tell you a brief and to get on and do it, that is what I got from him. With no justification. That was very formative for me. Someone of his eminence would take me seriously! I didn’t deserve that at all. So that was very useful to me. But I had kept in touch with Mike Parker, and when Jackson retired and he moved up, he hired me and I relocated. I worked long hours, all weekend, as I had a pent up bunch of stuff. And then I knew that this place was for me. My time since 1960 was preparation for going there. 

DM
You said in the 1960s type went from 3d to 2d and changed completely?

MC
Right. After Paris I went to M-L and had to make drawings. My drawing is not great so I used french curves and straight edges, but I had to make production drawings; photofonts were made with my drawings, re-photographed. So a mistake in the drawing was a mistake in the font. A direct process. A good edge quality. I continued to do that for a long long time. 

DM
You said you don't depend on inspiration? No bolts from the blue. If I asked you to draw on a blank page, it would stay blank all week?

MC
Yes. I have an artist friend in NYC, and she was doing a portfolio of prints of Bob Dylan. She wanted a special typeface for this. I loved her work. We talked about what kind of type it would be. I said to Leslie, where do your print ideas come from? I tried to put on Bob’s music and see what happened. “Give me an A? Nothing.” So I went the hard way. Inspiration is for amateurs ;) 

DM
So in 1981 you and a small ground made Bistream to license fonts. How did you see the way it would go that early?

MC
Its a fallacy that it started with the Mac in the mid 80s. It was 10 years old by then. Linotype made high speed digital type devices to replace photo type machines. As a linotype designer I got to work on digital type. But it was a strange period; Linotype had a huge strong market position especially in the USA. But that was eroded as more companies came into the business, Compugraphic and others. Mike had an aggressive type development programme based on the success of phototype machines, but we saw that was not going to continue. 90% of revenue was machines. Type was 10% and it enabled the machines to work. So type was only a small part of the business. And Mike and others at Linotype thought that there were exciting digital companies with no typographic knowledge. A company in Israel, Zytex (?) had these geniuses with high powered machines and no type! They could make their own but it would take too long. So Mike said, instead of making type for only Linotype’s machines, we could license it. But the management could not bear that thought. Forget it. So 4 of us made Bitstream. We did outside LInotype what we wanted to do inside. We had good designers. We made digital type very fast for Scitext and others. But everyone was blown out of the water by Adobe and Apple. But these whole page typesetting systems that were powerful had many vendors then. I stayed 10 years. 

DM
WHy did you leave?

MC
At that point, Cherie and I were left. Mike and Rob Freedman had left. C and I disagreed with the board about the company direction. The new president’s skills were not what was needed. ANd I’d been there 10 years, only designed 1 typeface, Charter! I was in mid 50s, and I thought, if I am to draw another typeface, I couldn’t do another meeting about who got what parking space! So we quit to make C&C. Berlow had left 18 months earlier to make The Font Bureau, and we were friends a long time and we were in touch. That business seemed to be viable. That encouraged Cherie and me to take the plunge. A kithen table top type fonudry. 

DM
Georgia! How did MS approach you? Tell me the story

MC
Right. In the mid 90s, well, 93 or 94, after we made C&C, we were approached by MS with a very interesting idea. Up to that point people not only designers but the public saw screens as a preview mode. You input and designed and then output print. MS saw that this would change. That the screen would soon become the priority, and the fonts were print fonts adapted to screens. They were poor, aliased displays. No greyscaling. So they said, how about I design a sans and a serif whose first priority is screen legibility. I said, philisophically this is wrong. A typeface is made for a technology, then its self obsoleting. Tech changes. I had made a typeface to mitigate the problems of early digitla typesetting machines, Charter, and before we knew it, the engineers who I had total faith in, they would make better screens and like Charter it wouldn’t be needed. But MS said to expect these screens for 10 years. So I agreed. The designs for Georgia and Verdana were great for me. I love working with engineers. And tackling these problems, how to make a bitmap? Charles Eames said he would make work with constraints, not compromises. That was my aim: To study as much I could what happens to fonts on screen. So I learned from that, and edged my way into it. Those are the jobs I really like. Its a screen that is a mess, you see the spacing is bad, and fix it. That is for me! I got really into that. We did Verdana first. Found that it was originally intended for menus, as a system font, but what I did to make it more legibile was spacing it out, and the boxes and menus in German or Finnish didn’t fit, so the narrow version was made, Tahoma. Then they said while you are at it, do a serif type. I studied pixels, and wrapped outlines around that, then Tom Rickner made those back into pixels with hinting. And MS was dead on with that prediction. In 1996 they were released and that was the tipping point for more digital communication than printed communication. So then I was very fond of the MS staff that I worked with and I look back on that with much pleasure. It was a project that came by way that I was perhaps most suited for because of my experiences. 

DM
And no royalties?

MC
Would I be here if I had? ;) No, sadly not. First MS hadn’t thought about giving them away but then they did to make the platform better. So no, but that was factored into the price and I had no complaints about the price paid that knew it was a one shot buy out with no residuals. 

DM
In 2010 I read you avoided the Kindle due to “typographic sins” 

MC
Me? Really? Oh. :)

DM
And then you could read with Georgia on the Kindle years later. What were those sins? 

MC
I don’t remember this but I expect it was more the layout than the font. I do read on screens but I read a lot of paper. And I do like to read with Georgia. There might be better type now, but I am very used to it now. 

DM
Abbott Miller, another Pentagram partner, he said “MC is a problem solver, a synthesiser, a radical.” And you said “there are 2 type designers, like Unger, Zapf, Goudy, where their genius comes through all their work and I can see Unger’s personality in everything he does. I don’t have that genius and I am more a chameleon.” Really??

MC
Yes :) There are these designers historically and today who have this strong style. Gerard is a good friend and we did a revival together. He said, “the problem is fleischman goes in and what comes out is unger” but for me as a chameleon I get inside Fleishmann’s head and what Abbott said is nice but Snell has no personality. I am not being coy. I think about this and I have talked to other designers about it. The consolation for not having a personal sense of letterforms that shines through is that you are more adaptable. So I enjoy revivals and never turn down a job - I like a new challenge. I never say “I am not the kind of designer who does _that_.” I don’t feel that way. I welcome any project. So I made peace with that; I admire Adrien or Gerard or Hermann but maybe it is easier for me channel them. 

DM
What was it like to get the MacArthur grant?

MC
They set me up very well. I got an email from a RIT student in Chicago. She said she wanted to feature me in a project about type and technology and would I do a telephone interview. This email is common but this one was very well done, so I said yes. She said it will be in September, can we fix a date and time to call you. Sure, I said, and put it in my diary. I got the call and expect to talk to an intelligent and interesting woman. But a man says, “were you expecting a call from X?” And said “yes” And he said “I’m sorry to say she doesn’t exist! But you won’t be sorry to hear from me :) Do you know the MacArhur Foundation? Know any fellows?” I said yes, I know 2, Chuck Bigelow. “Now you know 3!” and I said “huh?” I didn’t get it lol. But he persuaded me that it was me. He said that most MacArthurs go to people in 30s and 40s, but sometimes they do go to people in their 60s and 70s. That is an amazing thing. Normally for a grant like that you can apply. But not this one. At the end of the call he said “this is the last you will hear from me.” And then you get something in the mail that says its real, and then the checks arrive. No accounting for what to do with the money. They give the awards to a lot of people. Chuck got his early in like 1982. He had not made a typeface by then. He said he wasn’t a type designer at the time, so I may be the only one. They call me from time to time for references. I adore them. But it dribbles out over 5 years and when it stops there are some withdrawal symptoms ;) And it is taxable. 

DM
Yes, I knew a Fellow who paid his kids college funds with it. 

MC
Its amazing. 

DM
I loved that you said “someone expects more from you”

MC
Yes, and if its TDC or anyone, when I get a medal or award, its very nice. But it does make you think, they have some faith in you, so you better look up to it. 

DM
I wish I had 4 more hours to continue this talk about your work and life. But we have only a few minutes left for some final questions. You have worked across all the type media. And yet you have no favorites and no regrets in your work?

MC
No. I think an author was asked this and she said “I can't tell you because the others are listening.” I feel the same way. I can’t comment on my own work or others’ designs. The one I am working on! :) Same for letters. If you favor one, it suggests you disfavor others. When drawing type, if you like a ‘g’ but your ‘p’ is no good, it won’t fly. I think like any type designer, I react not to type as object but in its context of use. I say “wow that is a great use of a typeface” - or the opposite. And as a type designer you learn more in the “misuse” that is unexpected. That is very instructive. Should I have done something that could withstand such “abuse” better? And its great to see things done well with what you made. 

DM
You told Graphis magazine that “It is important to know at the end of they day that I have made something.” 

MC
Right. It isn’t like when I was 18 with a piece of steel in my hand, but I have my files in my computer. I always liked that designers talk about themselves as makers. And I have no plans to retire! MacArthur notwithstanding. I work full time although my stamina is not what it was. I love this work. 

DM
It has been an honour to interview you! 

MC
I am amazed with your research, you seem to knew it all already :)
