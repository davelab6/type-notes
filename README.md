type-notes
==========

A collection of "live blogging" notes about type design from events around the world.

Usual disclaimer for live blogging: 
These are informal notes taken by me, Dave Crossland, at the event, and may or may not be similar to what was said by the people who spoke on these topics. 
This is probably FULL of errors. 
What do you want for free? :) 
If something here is incorrect it is probably because I mistyped it or misunderstood, and if anyone wants corrections, just should tweet me â€“ [@davelab6](https://twitter.com/davelab6) - or [file an issue](https://github.com/davelab6/type-notes/issues) - or email me <dave@lab6.com>

People sometimes ask me why I take these notes.
The real reason is simply personal:
I would like to pay attention to 10 hours of lectures about type, that is indeed something the executive function of my mind wants to do.
But I acutually find it quite difficult to actually carry this task out, to just sit there and pay attention.
But if I focus my mind on listening to the lecture and writing down what is being said, I enter a kind of hypnosis where I can pay attention much longer.
You'll see that this doesn't work forever, and the notes become more disjointed later in the day.

But, having taken them, I am happy to publish them in in their raw form, full of errors and omissions.
If you weren't there, maybe this warped glimpse is still useful.
The web was made for sharing, afterall. 
And while these notes are not an accurate record of the lecture contents, useless for scholars, still they may be useful for dilettantes like myself :)

Thanks!
