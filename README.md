type-notes
==========

A collection of "live blogging" notes about type design from events around the world.

Usual disclaimer for live blogging: 
These are informal notes taken by me, Dave Crossland, at the event, and may or may not be similar to what was said by the people who spoke on these topics. 
This is probably FULL of errors. 
What do you want for free? :) 
If something here is incorrect it is probably because I mistyped it or misunderstood, and if anyone wants corrections, just should tweet me â€“ [@davelab6](https://twitter.com/davelab6) - or [file an issue](https://github.com/davelab6/type-notes/issues) - or email me <dave@lab6.com>

Thanks!
