## Keep it Simple  Françoise Berserik

I am a stone carver, letter carver, and book designer who told others to do the work. 

Today is the i18nal womens day, my Mum did interior designer training in WW2 and my parents met in 1942 at the college. Dad was an illustrator. 

My earliest childrens books had a layout and pictures I loved. My first book, made when I was 6. Great typography :) I did a series on nature later on, as I wanted ot be a biologist - still do. 

Here is a later book, De Ark. My father did 100s of book cover illustrations with hand lettering. He was very good, and Jan Middendorp mentions him in the Dutch Type book, on page 102 and 103 ;) 

Here is Edward Johnston. Here I am at Arnhem art college, becoming a graphic designer. This painting [of a page of text] is a typographic dream. Here is a photo of me redistributing metal tpes in the college. They organized a trip to a NL island in the nrth. I saw these gravestones with letter carvings painted black. These stones with a chapter by Gill [a book] on letter carving inspired me. I was encouraged by Alexaner [???] to take up the craft. In 1970, he encouraged us to paint letters big and fast, an x height of 20-25cm, and then we spaced out a word using the letters on a wall, and took a photo with a high contrast b&w film from the back of the room, and made prints much smaller - x height of 4-5 cm - to make text. Stiff numbers, punctuation much too small. 

Here was a photosetting system that Gerrit Noordzji made to do a similar thing. GN was an important person in my life, here he is at 30 years old as a colleague of my father at the art college. He and my father proposed I go to Reading's "typography unit" that Michael Twyman founded that became the department. Here is my timetable there in 1972-73. James Mosley lectures, and bookbinding, letter carving. 

Wooden type of Fry's Baskerville from teh dept. Only 1 photo of me working there. Here is a timetable for public transport. An instruction for setting type for news at a publishing house. The highlight was a dept trip to Florence, and I show the photos I took there at the start of every carving class. Here we are at the Trajan col; a huge disappintment as the letters are so high up, and we soon found MUCH MORE interesting lettering around. Here we are taking a nap, and Twyman is on the very right, and also Robin Kinross is there. There is regularlity, irregularity, and smoothness. This is some of my work, in French Sandstone, this is a poem by Philip Larkin, about life and death. This is a detail of a Mondrian painting in blue Belgian stone. 

After Reading I got a job at a London printing house production dept, doing binding schemes. Here is the only piece I have left, showing a biology book. After that I went freelance and I am still. A honey label. A magazine on censorship. An art gallery, here is the staff. The Whitechapel Art Gallery, design that was very economical. 

I wanted to go back to school to learn to draw. I could only do cats ;) I did 'scientific illustration' at Middlesex Polytechnic. This is defining an object with shade. This is pen and ink, with no pencil sketching, which taught me a lot. This is the skeleton of a hen. 

Another big leap; back to Den Haag, and the house I am still living in. Numbers and other signs painted onit, and a chance for collection. I love these small penguin books, pelican paperbacks. I had a room full. I also collected book bindings. Here are some cover designs, one by van Krimpen. Here are binding designs I did for an American publisher; I thought science books could have very bright colors. My brother worked as an illustrator after I commissioned him. 

You can't imagine how hard it was to get good letter designs on book covers then. Here is a specimen of Cloister Old Style by Bendon at Lanston Monotype, that I cut to use on a cover. A nice Gill Shadow. Some rub down method covers, in Gill and Futura. It was a LOT of work to make a same size model of a cover. Bottom right is the real cover; the other 3 paint on platsic and colored paper and photocopies. 

Another leap: This is Hank Bell, a freelance editor who HAD A COMPUTER. The first editor in NL with one. I asked him to help me. I tried to sort out editorial problems myself. I could draw layouts for him, and take on many large productions. We still do. This is our work room; with rubbings from Rome and Florence on the wall, with many other pieces pinned up. Viktor and Hattie, cats, asleep. A garden corner. Some Hanzi calligraphy. A piece for Anthony Frohaug, a well known English typographer. 

I am always discussing how to stone carve printing type. This is Gill, on a stone I erected myself at highgate cemetary for Anthony with special non-ranging figures. 

This is a headpiece for a bauhaus teacher Paul Citroen, with a typeface by Fred Smiejers, who made a Bold face specially for this job. This is the finished stone. 

here is an experiment, a date on top of a small stone for a cat, Sadja. 

I loved smooth letters, completely worn out, in the floors of Dutch churches with 300 years of feet shuffling on them. This is another experiment that went wrong, a bread stamp, about the size of a bar of soap. A nice thing but not working as a bread stamp. 

I took on a large commission to make formulas for the Haag Art Commission. I learned a lot about scale. Then I was commissioned in England. This design is based on 5 layers of brick. We had to lay the carved bricks back into the wall "van ostanskool" (?) here in Den Haag. Then Martin Majoor called me out of the blue to teach his beginners class which was great, students who never used a broad nib brush before. I asked them to work fast and it was great fun.

Here is on the left is the first letter-carving class in teh garden of the colege in 1995, the course would become type & media. 

Clients ask me for relief work, but I'd never done it before. This is my first relief in marble, a goose with wings far too short. This is in blue belgian stone. Another bird, more lettering by fred. A dog in stone and in granite that is painted. You can see how I paint stone. 

Robin Kinross asked me to design a standard for a series of paperbacks for Hyphen Press: Counter Punch, Type Now, Modern Typgoraphy. We commiicated by fax, it was before email, and you could send letters and sketches. Left is ToC, right is a series of piectures to start each chapter with. More sketches by Fred. We discussed a lot of things. Here is the 'mini mini' page 26. 

I designed many compicated books, such as this one for music. This is a binding scheme for a book in duotone, 3 tone and full color, for a well known dutch illustrator. I wroked for an American publisher with offices in illustrator and amsterdam; the large monitors date the photos. This is a house that does its own typesetting. We defined a method for doing layouts and covers quickly. All these books, 250-300, I designed. I can't even remember them all. But we had defined a quick method. I did a 8cm high sketch. Over the years they bought some nice typfaces. 

Back to carving, this is a 17th centory like sign for the top of a warehouse. Another house sign with a badger. Then my father died in 2002. This is the stone that I put in the walls of his house. Above, one of the earliest stones I made. The workshop I used had a large space. I like to do small stones, but some are so mig that they were carved at the quarries. This status of a famous Dutch poet, you see the moment of erecting it. The stone supplier's work is dirty and cold usually. Here I am in a client's garden. These serifs are rounded off which made them more legible; this was for a statue in front of a station in Wolle (?) 

I met [ pip? ] in 1997 in Reading ATypI, and I went up to Cumbria to work on a landscape-poetry stone carving project. She came to NL to work on the Garden of Realistic Art, doing 4 poems by local poets. 

...

I want to thank Erik and the typemedia students for cleaning up my grotty slides. Here is my walls today, more of the same. Also I am happy for finishing my carving alphabet design, a sample stone that comes with it. This is a project that takes forever. I still have a method for producing covers for the american publisher. Here is the copyshop where they print my emails, book covers, and complete books if needed. This is the copyshop dog. 

And this is my cat. I recommend to be like him. Sit in your own niche and always look out. 

Thank you. 

Erik: When I asked her to do a presntation, and she said she had 160 slides, I got nervous. I tried to say, maybe fewer. And you are 15 mins faster than the talk 

Marieke: Yes, I practiced :) 

Erik; So, we have more time. Lets show the movie with the test stones. 

Marieke: I will be around the event for any questions. 

Stephen Nixon: Is your stone alphabet a full glyph set?

Marieke: Yes, it was done for a particular job and then expanded

* * * 

## Oh dear, Python 3 is here

Erik: We have been ignorig p3 for too long. Get your notebook out, this is important stuff

Just van Rossum: Hello! 

This event gets more and more inimidating, and Paul gave my talk in the introduction already ;) 

So good to see all the typemedia gradautes, I'm overwhelmed with everone here, we could do an event with just coffeebreaks ;)

So, this talk is a technical one for those scripting things with Python. 

Python 3.0 came out in 2008. 

First RoboFog was in 1996, we built the application, who remembers it? [ 10-20 ] It was Fontographer 3.5 using Python 1.4 or so. I set out to do a timeline slide but didnt manage. Python 1.5.2 was a very stable release we used a long time. 

Python 2 had new things, largely compatible, and biggest thing was unicode. But then fog fell apart; Fontographer 3.x didn't support unicode. 

Then Yuri came with FontLab and at the time he wanted a scripting lagnuage. FL4 in 2001 had Python support, a big thing for us, so we could continue building thing our own way. We made scripts that became RoboFab and then UFO. 

We were in Python 2 land  and it was a gradual transitoin. People didecided that Python 2 was not good enough for the futre. Do I mhave 10 mins left? ;)

Python 3 is not backward compatible. pretty annoying. Some syntactic changes, and some fundemental changes, including Standard LIbrary chagnes. 

BUT WHY??!?! :)

Guido van Russom did a talk at a Vancouver pythong talk, The 'unicode mess' could not be fixed without breaking compatiblity. The "warts" were things badly designed that required a single incomatible chagne. 

Ptyhon 2 is now nearing End Of Life. No Python 2.8, the 2.7.14 is the latest and the final final updates are planned in 2020. 

Python 3 is the future, it is better, and there is no way around it. 

Why do we bother now? Its been 10 years. Well, we stuck our heads in our sand and hoped the problem would go away. Didn't happen. 

Python 2.7 is feature rich enough for us. We are mostly not professional developers. In early days we lacked 3rd library support, migration was a hassle with questionable benefits, and being 2 and 3 compatible was hassle too. "Do we LOOK like programmers?" Our community don't get jobs in IT soon with their skills and wouldn't want to. 

So, Guido presented this and "what went wrong," the popularitty and importance of 3rd party packages, a workflow for migration was clumsy, and so on. 

So, today 3.6.4 is nicely stable, its faster, and it has MUCH BETTER unicode support. I should have put that on each slide :) And migration isn't as bad as we feared, and there are more tools for doing it. 

    # python2
    print "Hello World"
    
    # python 2 and 3
    print("Hello World")

So, could this have been done another way? Maybe, but having print as a method like any other is nice, so eg string redirection is east. 

    def moveTo((x,y)):  # SyntaxError in v2
      ...
    def moveTo(pt):  # works everywhere
      x, y = py

This was needed for code introspection. 

    >>> 5 / 2  # v2
    2
    >>> 5 / 2  # v3
    2.5

This is now what you expect as a regular person. 

There is a 'future' mode that we enabled in RoboFont, so that Python 2 does what Python 3 would do. Also, you can make v2 deny code that won't work in v3. 

    >>> 5 // 2
    2
    >>> 5 % 2
    1

There is a new double-slash for dividing in the old way, and the modulo operator returns the remainder. This can be used to check if its odd or even, as 1 is odd and 0 is an even number; a trick everyone should know. 

    import submodule # could be from global or local source, v2 only
    from . import submodule # Unambiguous, v2 and v3

If you write a module, you can import another submodule from the package. 

Finally, Uncode vs binary data. 

Python 1 is from 1994, its predecessor began in 1985, and had string and binary literals. 

Python 2 adds a new `unicode` type, but when dealing with file data it was string data, and you think your code is working nicely, but then unexpected data could make it go awry. Conversion of str and unicode was common and error prone. Silent bugs were common. 

So, python 3 separates binary data from text; `bytes` for binary and `str` which is pretty much the unicode type from v2. if you want to convert bytes to str, you have to do that explicitly. This makes a clear distinciton between literal text and literal data, and once you go over your code to make those distinctions, you will be guarnatteed to be free of silent errors. 

    data = getSomeBinaryData()
    s = unicode (data, "utf-8")  # v2 only
    s = data.decode("utf-8")     # v2 and v3
    data = s.encode("utf-8")     # v2 and v3

The `unicode` and `basestring` builtins are gone

The `b"\xff\x00"` does nothing in v2 and `u"Unicode"` does nothing in v3 (although its valid) 

Iterators are more widespread in v3, esp in the `range()` method. in v2 it returns a `list`, but in v3 it returns an `iterable`, which means if you want a list, you need to convert. 

    l = list(range(5)) # inefficient in v2!!
    l.append(123)

And the same for `zip()` and `map()`. The `xrange()` builtin is gone, its no longer needed. 

There is a new `sorted()` builtin that returns a sorted list. `iterkeys` etc are gone. Good. 

One gotcha is that in Python 2 you can iterate over the list and change it while you go, but in v3 you can't change the dictionary size during iteration. This is a sound idea so its good to disallow it. 

So, what to do if you want to take your head out of the sand as we are doing now?

You can stay with v2 but slowly prepare for v3

You can move to v3 wholesale

Youc an adaprt v3 but maintain v2 compatibiliy using some glue code, eg ``__future__`` directives, the `six` module and `fontTools.misc.py23` that thanks to Behdad and Cosimo help with subtle things. 

    from __future__ import division # 5/2 returns 2.5
    from __future__ import print # require print()
    # etc

    from fontTools.misc.py23 import *
    range() # brings v3 to v2
    round()
    # etc

What is cool in v3? 

Much better unicode support, a single class system and argumentless super() calls that are much nicer. 

And string formatting is new and nicer, what are called "f strings" or "format strings" 

In v2 the `.format` string method was added, that replaced `%` placeholders with `{}`.

now you can do `print(f"Math: {a} + {b} = {a+b}")` which is nice. 

I ported DrawBot to v3 to see how to do it. Behdad took on fontTools in 2013 and began work on this, and community began work on ufoLib and defcon, and then quietly PyObjC had full v3 support. Cosimo ported vanilla, after much delay from us, and that made things much easier. 

What helped me port DrawBot a lot was: 

* automated tests, YOU MUST WRITE TESTS if you take your code seriously. Cosimo has done an awesome job at fontTools to set that up and make tests run automatically on Github so you can see it tested. 

www.python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html has many good tips for this. 

Thank you!

## RoboFont #.#

Frederik Baerlan

Good afternoon! Good to be back, see all the familiar faces from all around the world. 

RoboFont v3.0 will be the 14th release of RoboFont, released at 2011 in Iceland, a long time ago. 2 releases a year, a good average compared to, no ;) 

It has UFOv3, Python v3, finally finally. When you download it later today or tomorrow, a lot didnt change for you; a lot of internal changes. 

The core idea of what a type designer's applciation is a solid point that works for many people.

* It is a simple UFO editor. Its a public format specified so you know what goes in and out. it edits what goes into a UFO, nothing more and nothing less. 

* It has "no knowledge", i do not push my way to look at a design to my users. users have to make their own way to work with a tool, when you have offices around the world you can make your own workflows that are different for different people. 

* It is a platform and environment for design. I think it is important that you can get stuff done. 

The RoboFont 2.x line is over with ufo THREE and python THREE, so now RoboFOnt is v3. The versions of v2.something with their v3 support are rare, if you have them, keep them. 

www.UnifiedFontObject.org has the ufo specs, and ufo2 has 3 files and then a glyphs folder with GLIF files and a contents.plist. v3 introduces more folders; an images folder for background images, named layers like glyphs.background that has a new layerinfo.plist, and a data folder for any other data you want. 

Since UFO2 was released, a lot of industry changes happened, WOFF, Color Fonts, and Variable Fonts. 

RoboFont v1.x had support for many of these things already, so for users not much changed; it used to store that data inside the 'lib.plist' or glif 'lib' element, but it was a hacky way to go based on drafts that Erik and Tal wrote. So now they are implemented differently in a better way that is compatible with different implementations like FontLab, GlyphsApp and other things. 

Your precoius UFO2 data has to be upgraded to UFO3, scary! There is ufoLib, the library does that a lot of this conversion which works very well. But its very strict on data that comes in and out. If you send a float to an int value, it complains. That is good. Your data stored on your disk should be valid data! 

python3 was introduced nicely by Just, and the thing that inspires me to write RoboFont for v3 was Just's work on DrawBot; it was just one evening of work for me. Print works differently, all strings are unicode with emoji, and division and other things are different.

You have to upgrade your UFO data, and then your code. It was important that the change was done for the core, and the extensions and scripts. There is also some convenience things:

    from vanilla.py23 import *
    import mojo.py23
    help(mojo.py23)

So, freaky, you have to get to work on MOnday and deal with this. One thing is, RoboFab is discontinued and replaced with fontParts, as Ben Kiel will talk about next, RoboFab was coupled to what FontLab v4 did, and fontParts has the convenience of fab and the independence of defcon, which was too low level. fontParts has methods like `getLayer()` which was already in RoboFont v1. 

RoboFab's Pens have spread out to fontTools, ufoLib and fontPens; the latter has the pens that are more fun and cool. 

For RoboFont extension, I made the `one2three.roboFontExt` extension that helps with the API differences, warning when things moved around in defcon. Eg, notifications are coming from another place, or problems where RoboFab isn't going to be there. This will help you write extensions. 

RoboFont 3 can require other extensions. If you try to write extensions for both, you can require that extension, and keep on working. 

The app itself didn't change much, it has FAST start up thanks to Georg; and opening any kind of UFO is fast in 4-5 seconds. Hopefully you can draw a lot more ;)

The Space Center is now super fast with 1,000s of glyphs, so Nina's extension will work well. 

And it validates incoming UFO2 files and report back; if its really bad it wont open and just give a report. 

The independent layers are now there from UFO3, and you can generate from a specific layer; components can refer to their own layer. 

A lot of preferences changed, you can make your own shortcuts, for any menu item. 

There is also a preferences editor, a simple JSON thing that you can edit. 

The script editor has syntax completion so quotes and brackets auto-close. This will be in DrawBot soon too. 

Suprising? This is not a free ugprade. I can not do it again as a free update. The last 7 years only 3 were paid. I think its now a good time for another. It is the same pricing, and free if you bought it in the last 12 months, and there is a 30% discount the next 3 months. 

There is a lot of work on documentation. The online docs were old and not updated; I have a new way to write docs, and XXX is helping with this. He looks at me writing code, and writes his docs, with the perspectives of a user. This is rewritten and expanded in a good direction. 

We made a new font; what kind of font do you make for a font edior? Not boring, something personal. My intern helped me finish this, an ex-student from Ghent. 

www.robofont.com/documentation/how-tos has lots of tips ,and www.robofont.com/documentation/extensions has tips for writing them. 

www.robofont.com/documetnation/tools too. 

education.robofont.com also has options for schools; a trial is 30 days, a student is 1 year (not extensible) and a Student lincense service that is extendable for a yearly subscription. I think RoboFont should be free for all students and the school should pay just a little bit and admin the licensing. 

forum.robofont.com/recent is there

extensionstore.robofont.com is all new. The problem was this; there is Github/mechanic, its free and public but dev doesnt get paid which is important. Or, they get paid making custom extensions which are not free or public. It is nice to share tools, so I came up with a middle man, the Store is not free but it is publilc and they do get paid. 
fi you are in the extensions store, you get a T shirt ;) and a stick that says you are a certified developer. 80% for the develoeprs and 20% goes to maintainng the website and so on. Just contact me, the reqs are valid RoboFont v3 code. 

An example is Find & Replace. This finds a selection of points. It can also fit and rotate. Its a cheap one. 

MetricsMachine is coming to the extension store, a big annoucment, and it will live in your menu bar. Its a complete thing. 

Tal wrote a dramatic post that he was spending time on drawing, so I helped him out in NYC to move to the UFO3 world. It isn't a separate application, it is an extension, so you can edit bulid drawing. It has the UI as it was, ported to be the same, and we have ideas for new versions when Tal is more available. 

Prepolator is also there. There is an Extension Store extension, like Mechanik. If you want to be listed, contact me. 

Thank you.
